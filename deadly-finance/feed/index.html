Then I reached my goal, muhaha :D It started with an article about DeepMind a couple of weeks ago. Then Carl added the Wait But Why link to the AI posts and I just went down the rabbit hole since then. Honestly interesting and terrifying topic. I would happily wait for a happy ending in hibernation. Maybe, meanwhile, Neuralink will create the wizard hat so we could continue interacting from the other side...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks man. Now I&#039;m scared out of my wits! ;-)
Good food for thought. I try to fight the inevitable with exercise and good habits, but I also try to stock up on regret avoidance as well. Happy hibernating, friend!]]></description>

I share your worries as overpopulation could cause serious harm with the current mindset and way of living. What I tried to point out that with an increased population the collective brainpower of humanity could also increase and maybe this could lead us to find better solutions much faster. It is true that our food resources are finite and an exponential population growth could cause hard times. Same time besides the development of agriculture and expansion of the growing areas (maybe into space?) the first punchline should avoid waste. Our current food supplying system (and the way of consumption) works in a very inefficient way and optimizing this could help to solve the problem, at least partially. Also if we would not prolong our lifetime biologically but would go through a transition and &quot;upload&quot; ourselves and continue living in the cloud, that could also lower our carbon footprint :)]]></description>
