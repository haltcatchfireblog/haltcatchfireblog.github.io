					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the compliment, I like that post, it is one of the few which is really close to my heart.

I have read your post back when I discovered your blog, so at least you have some base material for answering the new questions. Not that you have any problems with writing thousands of words or something... :)

Just send over your answers to Carl when you can, the waiting list is changing dynamically, at first my date was 7th of December ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved reading your answers to one of my favorite series of 2-3 years ago! I didn&#039;t realize the series restarted and now I see there&#039;s a 6 months waiting list :o

Sadly, when Carl decided to stop the series I answered the questions on my blog (https://retireinprogress.com/10-questions/)

Anyway, your expected-to-be-viral post (about hyperinflation in Serbia in the 90s) is awesome!]]></description>
