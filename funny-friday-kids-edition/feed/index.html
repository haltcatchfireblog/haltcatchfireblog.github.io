Thank you Sam. Actually after second you will have less time and more worry :) Having was not a question at all. Actually I would love to have one more kid, but we will see. The only thing I could tell, if you enjoy having one kid around two will add to that.The only thing that both joy, worry and complexity will increase not on a linear but exponential way :) What keep you from having the second?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hah! Great memes.

Did your worry lessen when you had your second?  How did you guys think about going for number two and what was going on in your head? I will probably have this thought process more more in the next 12 months. 

Thx
