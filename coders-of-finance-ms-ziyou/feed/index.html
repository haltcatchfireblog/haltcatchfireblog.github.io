					<description><![CDATA[Fascinating story Ms ZiYou!

It looks like we&#039;ve shared a very similar career path, the &quot;I’ll basically do anything if they pay me the right amount&quot; approach summarises freelancing well indeed!

Absolutely agree with your thoughts on encouraging kids to learn sciences. Programming should be a core competency for everyone these days, basic concepts like control of flow and efficient design are applicable to everything from setting up a kitchen to designing processes around financial month end at mega-corp.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Mr Groovy, thanks for your kind comments.

Yeah, it does sound like a shame you didn&#039;t discover programming until later in life - although I&#039;m glad you found your calling in the end.

And yes, I don&#039;t actually write code outside work, so I can see me following your path and not writing code when I retire too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Ms ZiYou. I really enjoyed learning about your story. I started coding rather late in life (late 30s). I wish I would have discovered it sooner. I&#039;m not saying I would have been a fantastic programmer, but I seem to have been tailor made for the vocation. I never got frustrated with a problem. I would just keep plugging away until I solved it. Anyway, I&#039;ve been retired for almost two years now. And I haven&#039;t written a lick of SQL or VBA since I said goodbye to gainful employment. I do miss the coding, though. Hope all is well on the other side of the pond. Cheers.]]></description>
