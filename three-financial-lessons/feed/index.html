					<description><![CDATA[Just discovered this post because just discovered you did 10 questions on 1500 blog because just discovered you mentioned me there.

Amazing post, nice story! Btw, your 500kkk Dinar bill is NOTHING compared to the Zimbabwean 100kkkk Dollars!

A hundred trillion dollars!

P.S. why nobody considered Italian Lira as a Stable Asset.... hahahahaha!]]></description>

Neither did I. I was a kid back then and knew barely nothing about economics so was not bothered a lot. Same time cannot even imagine how scary would have been those days for my parents and grandparents. Just the fact that I know they lived through such times raises my already high levels of respect towards them.]]></description>

Wow, that&#039;s high. The Hungarian minorities had their hard times everywhere. Also, it should be noted that some people ended up as winners of the situation. I heard stories about people who took out mortgages then because of the hyperinflation paid it back with new money with the value of a pack of matches... Crazy times.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haltcatchfire.com/three-financial-lessons/#comment-14&quot;&gt;My Sons Father&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks. It was. Imagine a fourth grader trying to figure out how much of these should he give the cashier for a bottle of milk. Back then I was not even able to say out these amounts. The banknotes only had nicknames. I remember once my mom was mad at me because I lost 50k dinars on the road to home from the store. By the time that was the price of a bubble gum... now it&#039;s roughly the quarter of my salary. Crazy times...]]></description>
