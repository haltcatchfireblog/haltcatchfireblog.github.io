					<description><![CDATA[Excellent article, I need to truly improve the content I have.

I have attempted to blog on third-party systems, it did just not transpire the true way I needed it to. However, your website has given me a desire to do this. I am bookmarking your website and check it out every once in awhile.

Many thanks!]]></description>

I cannot agree more. When you fixed the leaking of the ship you should just enjoy the ride and sometimes check the compass to be sure you are heading to the right direction. Thanks for reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am not a big fan of over thinking budgeting. I think it is a fantastic tool to show yourself where you are leaking money in your plan. However I don&#039;t think it is necessary once you establish a consistent system. I make sure I allocate money to all my investments every month and think through any windfalls of money earned. Then I go and enjoy life. Thanks for sharing.]]></description>
