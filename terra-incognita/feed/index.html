					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/terra-incognita/#comment-378&quot;&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks, Peter. Actually it did help to release some pressure indeed. I hear you on doctors, bless them. Call me a coward but I always stated that there are two professions I am pretty sure I won&#039;t take. One of them is becoming a doctor. I am pretty sure that I could not handle the pressure. They have all my respect. I hope that the sanctions both Serbia and Hungary put into action will prevent the situation to escalate that far but I am pretty sure that it will get worse before it will get better.
Well, I had a mild suspicion too. If the case is that indeed that only a small percentage of infections got discovered then it is possible. That&#039;s why I wanted to be precautious and minimized human contact as much as possible. From tomorrow all my coworkers start working from home. The streets get emptier day by day. So, I guess there is hope that we won&#039;t go from bad to catastrophe.
A few of my loved ones are from the most compromised age range so I can relate to your worries. Wishing all the best to You and your Mom. Stay home, stay strong ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey HCF, I hope you can ease your mind a bit and relax. I can relate to your post on multiple points since I also had mild influenza two weeks ago, also we have a few doctor friends who won&#039;t get much sleep in the following weeks, maybe months. If things get as bad as in Italy, they&#039;ll have to decide between life and death every ten minutes of their shifts. By the way, your flu might have been the virus actually, younger people&#039;s reactions are usually similar. Right now I&#039;m just hoping that my elderly mum will be alright. Damn, I wanted to cheer you up and it turns out I&#039;m depressed about the situation, sorry :&#124; Greetings from Hungary, keep safe!]]></description>

The government stated that the schools will stay closed at least until the start of the next school year. Our teachers are currently very busy as they are working on quickly establishing some kind of digital education. The government started to set up a platform for that and also the national television takes part. They will broadcast classes which will be accessible online also. It seems they take the protection of the elders pretty seriously. Today they announced that from tomorrow 10 AM there will be sanctions against people older than 65 who leave their homes. Meanwhile, young volunteers are gathering on every settlement to help to solve the distribution of supplies amongst older folks who don&#039;t have any help. Same time they announced another curfew which states that NO ONE should leave home their homes from 20 PM to 5 AM except those who have to take night shifts. I never thought that I will be happy about such a behest. My thoughts are with you. Take care.]]></description>

Thank You. I didn&#039;t see that movie for a while. Interestingly our country is awaiting and getting help now from our brothers in China. It seems communist brotherhoods last long.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I‚Äôm from Australia and our state declared a state of emergency on Monday ‚Äì yet our public schools are still open. I‚Äôm a teacher.
I wish they‚Äôd close us down. It feels like they‚Äôre putting teachers‚Äô health at risk because ‚Äúschools are full of young people who don‚Äôt tend to get the virus.‚Äù
Lots of us aren‚Äôt young.]]></description>
