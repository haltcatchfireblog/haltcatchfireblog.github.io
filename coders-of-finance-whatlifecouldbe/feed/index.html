You&#039;re right. Reducing costs was not at all a reason to move back, but you know...most people probably won&#039;t believe it. That&#039;s why I need to point out some hardcore facts :)
Plus, our life intensity is pretty crazy here. We travel a lot and do so many things (that involves cost) that in some months we have the same expenses than in Germany :)]]></description>

Maybe some people do so, but this statement seems wrong to me because of three reasons. First of all, you never stated that you have reached FI only by Romanian standards so I assume your model works also in Germany. Secondly, moving to a lower cost of living place maybe not an option for everyone, but note that moving to a place where there are more options and higher salaries is not a simple decision. There are many other factors besides the financial reasoning. And the third one is that I think that in the first place you did not move back to Romania to only reduce the costs but to be able to live closer to family and have an overall better standard of life. The reduced costs are only the topping on the cake :) Tell me if I am wrong.]]></description>

I know that many people first think that &quot;yeah, that was easy: achieving fi in Germany then moving to a cheap country to reduce costs...therefor I can&#039;t do it&quot;. Actually I&#039;ve tried several sidehustles that didn&#039;t require me being in Germany at all and earn over 100â‚¬/h. For instance I&#039;m updating a CMS based website for  about 130â‚¬/h in Romania after optimizing a lot of processes and minimizing the time I need for changes. Headhunting was also very lucrative and it didn&#039;t require my presence in Germany. 
The only reason somebody doesn&#039;t have a well-paid side hustle is because one never sets that as a goal...]]></description>

Hey, Matt. Sounds like a good master plan :)
Very inspiring story indeed. For me, the most interesting part that many times when we&#039;re talking about successful freelancers based in the US we tend to think that, yeah, it is easier to do so over there. Rob&#039;s example shows that it is pretty much possible here in Europe. I am very impressed with what they have achieved so far and really made me think about my current job and financial situation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very inspiring, 
 As someone who is trying to make the career switch to web design/development, I really enjoy this series.   
Maybe my family should move to Eastern Europe once our allotted time in Germany is up.  I need to get a thriving freelance business going and some passive income streams going so my wife can quit her job.]]></description>
