Thank you, Olivia! It feels like that indeed. I cannot imagine what do bloggers feel who are in it for decades :)
I&#039;ll do my best in sticking around.]]></description>

Oh, thank you, my friend. It is obviously not true, but I appreciate it :) You can bet that you will get more of it ;)
I have tried the trick with the alarm clock, but it did not work. I was so tired that was just sitting in front of the laptop staring at the blinking cursor. I think I was bad at getting into bed 1.5-hour earlier. That is the magical part of the equation, isn&#039;t it?
If the kids would sleep over the whole night it would help too. I cannot remember when did I sleep 4 hours continuously. Happy times :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations, mein freund! ;-) 

Stick with it. You write better in English than 99% of native speakers/writers do. I&#039;m looking forward to more intriguing posts that delve a bit into the coding side of things. Oh, and if you&#039;re looking for time to blog, just set your alarm clock 1.5 hours earlier. ;-)]]></description>

I used to learn German in the elementary and I hated it. I wasn&#039;t able to get the logic of the grammar. Even English is hard to learn as there are so many tenses. In Hungarian, we have only the three main ones. Maybe that makes it one of the hardest languages to learn. Viel Glück zum Lernen! And thanks for reading :)]]></description>

Thank you! I think you can do whatever you want in life, but the biggest part of your legacy for the world will be the adults you raise. There is no higher priority for me. Thanks for reading!]]></description>

Thank you, at least we are recovering. I try to apply Edison&#039;s mindset: “I have not failed. I&#039;ve just found 10,000 ways that won&#039;t work.”
Same for your blog. I was tempted to add to the wins that &quot;MSF did not die&quot;, but that is not my merit. Thanks for reading!]]></description>
