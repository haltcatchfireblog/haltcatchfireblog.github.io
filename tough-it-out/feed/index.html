					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/tough-it-out/#comment-369&quot;&gt;{ in·deed·a·bly }&lt;/a&gt;.

Your pissing story made me laugh also... At least we learn some lessons from these. Like you with the motorbike. Sometimes I also wonder how did we survive... We also had an experiment with the electric fence, just we were curious if we hold hands and make a chain everyone will be stuck or just the last one (hint: everyone will feel it but the last one will get the biggest hit). Also, don&#039;t try this at home :) Thanks for reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your tongue stuck on an icy post story made me laugh. 

These sorts of stories sometimes make me wonder how boys manage to survive into adulthood, give all the stupid misadventures they get up to. 

Alas, I can’t claim to have been any smarter than you were as a kid. I once pissed on a live electric fence (don’t try this at home kids!). The sort of mistake you only make once.]]></description>
