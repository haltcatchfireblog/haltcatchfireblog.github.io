It is a good way of thinking. Sometimes when I hear my parents and grandparents talking about the old days it blows my mind and I start to think that why do I complain at all... about anything. It seems that the saying &quot;everything was better back then when everything was worse&quot; contains some truth :) Thanks for stopping by!]]></description>

Thank you. Totally agree with you. It is shocking when you see people who live without those things which you consider as basics. It is even more surprising when you realize that you don&#039;t necessarily have to go to the far east to experience this. Sometimes you just need to look around. It&#039;s 2019 and there are still families here in the middle of Europe who are living in homes without electricity, running water or even indoor toilets. There are places where it seems time just standing still :)]]></description>
