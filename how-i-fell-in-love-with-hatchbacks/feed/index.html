Thanks for the compliment :) I still struggle with sentence constructions as I am not a native speaker. Most of the times I can just hope that I  am writing what I wanted to say. By the way knowing his father I am not absolutely sure if that was an empty threat :) Thanks for reading!]]></description>

Thanks for your approval :) It was a gem. I&#039;m still missing it. However the love is lasting as I drove only hatchbacks since then. And yes, Snatch is one of my favorites among &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haltcatchfire.com/escaping-the-matrix/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, Fight Club and its twin brother Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Guy Ritchie is a genius. Thanks for visiting!]]></description>
