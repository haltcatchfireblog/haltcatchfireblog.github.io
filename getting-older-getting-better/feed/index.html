Exactly. For first it took half a year to convince myself finally to start this blog. Also, I am analytical thinker by profession which has its downsides. Overengineering and overplanning is a common mistake I make. Just to demonstrate I have a title on my planned posts list: &quot;Plan the shit out of it and then do nothing&quot;. Needless to say, that I did not write it yet :D
Thanks for reading!]]></description>

You know that I do and I like it ;)

You are not the same person so it is natural that you don&#039;t agree with him at every point, but he did figure out a lot of &quot;it&quot; indeed. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was struck by the sentence Mr. Jump Start mentioned, and also this one:
&quot;Falling into the trap of eternal planning and constant procrastination is a real threat.&quot; 

Devouring much of the FI information is a double edged sword; there are so many great ideas and stories-- some of which may help you immensely, and other&#039;s that might cause you to spend time pursuing things you never wanted in the first place. Or make you think you&#039;re not taking action on your own plans when in reality, you probably are.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haltcatchfire.com/getting-older-getting-better/#comment-76&quot;&gt;Mr. JumpStart&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for your encouraging words. These thoughts haunting me often. My greatest fear is that I get rusty and apathetic in a life situation which I consider good enough, but later I will find out that it really isn&#039;t. That the fact that you are comfortable with your life keeps you from the desire to achieve more, just because &quot;it does not hurt enough&quot; to force you to go for it. And doing this while you have the potential buried inside you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The &quot;Good enough is the enemy of greatness.&quot; line struck me.
Sometimes being happy is appreciating what we have, and what we think is good enough is pretty great.  It is common for people to leave jobs, and later realize things weren&#039;t so bad at their old job.
Good enough is not the only enemy.  Sometimes our idea isn&#039;t good enough, so we never share it. Other times our plan isn&#039;t ready or good enough, so we never start.
I have many similar thought to those you mentioned.  Remember that you are reading some pretty exceptional stories.  Fight discouragement  and remember you can create a great story too.]]></description>

Thanks for your kind words. I totally agree with you. The only thing I wanted to add is (as I wrote above) not comparing is a two edged sword too. It helps you not worry, but also it can put you into a false calmness, that everything is just fine as is. So let me reframe the problem. The real task is to build a stable starting point (for which you could be grateful), then compare yourself to the right role models and then instead of whining about your situation (that totally was not my intent with the post) make a plan to replicate from their success what is important to you. Sounds better this way? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We all have these moments HCF. I would venture to say that every single person involved in the PF community has been where you are. This is to a large degree because modern life just never seem to quite fit as well as we imagine it when we are kids.

Having said this, you have discovered the one true path to happiness - being grateful. Focus on what you have, not what you want. Focus on you, not on what other people have achieved. 

Now once you&#039;ve done this, think about where you want to be. Take a step. Any step. Just do it. Walk slowly and over time you&#039;ll get there. Just one day at a time.

And for the love of all that is good don&#039;t compare yourself too much. Check out a great article that Millennial Revolution posted about comparing yourself just last week.]]></description>
