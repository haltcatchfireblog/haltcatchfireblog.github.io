					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/#comment-116&quot;&gt;Brent&lt;/a&gt;.

That deadline pressure almost killed the thing to me. Then I realized that these deadlines are just made up by me so what&#039;s the point in stressing about them? I try to post something every week now, but if there is a week with two posts or zero it is not the end of the world. I try to focus on the bigger challenge, keeping at it. Thank you for the encouragement, it always lights up my day :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/#comment-114&quot;&gt;Ty Roberts&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you Ty!

I made my decision to stick around because, however, it would be easier to leave the scene, but the company is too good around here. Instead I reframed my mindset. I don&#039;t really care about the results. I am here to make connections, friendships and to learn more. And of course while on the road, I will share my thoughts, but left strict schedules, I will sound my voice only when I will have something to say. My posting schedule changed to every sometimes :)]]></description>

I agree with you, this was definitely not the optimal period for jumping into blogging, but I did it and now looking forward to making it work somehow. You made me laugh, fortunately when I told about this blog to my wife her reaction was unexpected even to me. She said, &quot;I am so proud of you&quot;. I think this is a great reason to carry on. Thank you, and wishing a very Happy New Year for your family too :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So I was checking out a post by @genymoneyca about the difference in blogging from 2009 to 2017. She admitted to having some relationship difficulties that were blogging related - too much time spent blogging. Some guy named Rob wrote this comment:
&quot;Simple answer donâ€™t do it. blogging is a time suck which takes all you time, money attention and gives nothing back in return. It was bad in 2008 itâ€™s gotten much worse now with social media. If youâ€™re looking to make a difference in peoples lives join forums dedicated to your interest. Even now 8 years after I stopped blogging Iâ€™m still active on many forums. I never read blogs anymore (this one post being the exception â€“ see next my comment).&quot;
I don&#039;t know the answer. I don&#039;t want to discourage you, because I also like your posts, but I think it&#039;s okay to have doubts about whether blogging makes sense at this time in your life. When my kids were babies and toddlers, I wouldn&#039;t have managed blogging. And if my spouse was doing it, I would have probably killed him. Even now for me, with older more self-sufficient teenagers, some things are falling through the cracks with my blogging time. So, I&#039;m trying to keep my eyes wide open about whether it is a fun, creative outlet or just an unhealthy addiction that messes up my personal life. On that uplifting note...Happy New Year HCF and all the best in 2018 :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking back at my stats and posts, I have similar feelings.  I was at 1700 views after 3 months.  There have been low months like Jan and July where I only had about 250 views.  I&#039;m never sure which posts will be more popular. 
After about a year, I have begun to see a pickup in traffic and have over a 1000 views in Nov and Dec.
I&#039;ve got 11 email subscribers, and half of them are people I know personally.
I don&#039;t like to read my old posts because, it makes me want to go back and edit the hell out of them.
I have enjoyed reading HCF posts, and hope you stick around.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve got to do what&#039;s right for yourself, your health, and of course, your family. If the blogging stuff gets to be too much, you can always cut back on your post frequency, Twitter time, etc...

Stick with it long enough, put it great content, and you&#039;ll find lots of reasons to continue.

Cheers!
