					<description><![CDATA[Nailed it, Nelly. I can&#039;t stress enough how wonderful it is to be debt free. Case in point. Today, Mrs. Groovy and went into McDonald&#039;s and the counter clerk got our order wrong. She mistakenly added another vanilla cone to our bill. Now, when she handed us the extra cone, Mrs. Groovy and I both laughed and accepted it without a fuss. But had this occurred 15 years ago when we had debt up to our eyeballs, we would have freaked. Yes, it would have only added a dollar to our monthly expenses, but when you&#039;re living paycheck to paycheck, little things like that make you blow a gasket. Great post on the wonders of debt-free living. And great advice on how to achieve it. Bravo.]]></description>

It does not at all! There was no gender differentiation intent in writing that down. If you (or anyone out there) get offended by that word please blame on my lack of knowledge. English is not my mother language and it was just a thought of the moment if there is such a word. I did not want to hurt anyone and clearly was not writing that to differentiate her from myself. Actually, I think pretty much the opposite. She actually can call herself a blogger if you check her writing history. I still shy away from calling myself one as I don&#039;t feel that I have provided that much to the community to use this label comfortable. It makes me sad that this was the thing which made you leave a comment here. I apologize, it seems I have a special skill not expressing myself the same way as it sounds in my head. I will delete it. Peace.]]></description>
