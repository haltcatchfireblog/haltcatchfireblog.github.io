Sounds like a plan Mrs.Groovy. That&#039;s how I acquired the aforementioned laptop ;) They say that Cyber Monday is a thing now, I hope that we will adopt that, sounds useful. Thanks for checking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t step foot in a store but I do plan to look online. BestBuy has a deal on the iPad mini 4 for $275, rather than the normal $399 price. I believe Apple stopped making them and my mother-in-law is in the market.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So glad I don&#039;t work retail! Black Friday shopping is a crazy concept! Though in our college days we did go out with friends around midnight. We snagged four TVs (three for family, one for us) and had quite the ridiculous night doing so. Now we have the tradition of going to the brewery around 2 pm on Black Friday to enjoy some beers with friends!]]></description>
