Welcome, hope you will return every now and then ;)

Of course, I know... also, if you look close enough you will realize that on the picture it is Gandalf ;) I saw once this image and the text was like &quot;how to offend three fanbases at once&quot;.

You are welcome ;) You do indeed, but I don&#039;t think you should afraid of anything. What I see is that boredom and uselessness lead people to strange and daunting places. Not sure later how will this be but as a father, with small kids, I cannot really recall a moment when I was bored in the last 5+ years :D And there is so much out in the world just waiting for discovery. Don&#039;t you doubt that I envy you for getting so close to the finish line ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the shout out, my Hungarian brotha! I am truly playing with FIRE, aren&#039;t I?? It&#039;ll be a topic I pick at more in 2019, rest assured. If we all hated our jobs, we&#039;d find a reason to hate our lives while not working too...?

The Airbnb Experiment wrap up is on tap. It was a good year. Hope you get some worthwhile nuggets from that post. Cheers!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Truly honored to be one of the bloggers you mentioned. I&#039;m not worthy! In all seriousness, though, it really made my day. It&#039;s also an honor to have you on my list of must-read bloggers. Every time I come here I read something that makes me think. And that&#039;s a very wonderful thing. Hope you have a kick-ass 2019, my friend. Cheers.]]></description>

Not really sure about what would the job description include but send me an offer and I will think about it ;)

It is the most rewarding aspect indeed(ably).]]></description>

Me too, my friend. Unfortunately, I see no opportunity in the near future but in the long term jumping over the pond and having a road trip in that brave new world is definitely on my bucket list and I will knock on your door when I will be around ;)]]></description>
