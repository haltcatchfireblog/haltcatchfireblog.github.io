					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/escaping-the-matrix/#comment-12&quot;&gt;Ms ZiYou&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you :)

Actually, you are right with the word &quot;stable&quot;. That describes best the life and the economy over here. Of course only if you mean by that the growth charts are flat and nothing serious improvement is happening :) Of course there are exceptions but those are hard to notice. We really should have elected that Beli guy(Ljubi≈°a Preletaƒçeviƒá) at the last elections. At least we would have some fun in politics :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/escaping-the-matrix/#comment-10&quot;&gt;Mr W&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you, Mr. W. If you have watched it 20 times it definitely did have an impact. Watching that movie, then the Fight Club and reading a books foreword was the three breakpoints which made me think more seriously about &quot;the other path&quot;. Discovering the truth, that there is not only that one reality what others show us is an important epiphany. Thanks for reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Matrix was by far my favourite movie. I think it made me question things. I&#039;m not sure what impact it had on my way to FI but, after watching it about 20 times, i think, now that I read your post and read those quotes again, it probably had a higher impact than I thought. 
Your story and background is similar to mine and you might be the closest FI blogger geographically. 
I wish you all the best on your road and it&#039;s just a question of time when you&#039;ll get there too. And when you do, the real journey and the real goals will reveal themselves.]]></description>

Thanks, Chris. Me too. Zion is still a long way to go and sentinels are around, but I am buckling my seatbelt as Kansas is going bye-bye :D]]></description>
