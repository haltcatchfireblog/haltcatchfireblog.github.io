If your spending is intentional and you know your needs and limits then you can definitely be ok without a budget. Leading a simple life I am aware of our spending pretty accurately. Also, I have to admit I would turn to a budget immediately if I notice that something is wrong, the money is leaking and I have no idea where it goes. Until that point, I just don&#039;t bother.

I had to check what 93/7 and 80/20 ground beef is. In my country, the animal is the one who decides these percentages :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No budget either. Budgeting is a whole other level of pain for me. I do keep my checkbooks balanced and have a rough idea of what is coming and going every month - and I always figure if I totally screw up, I can lean on a credit card (gasp!) for a month or two. But I really haven&#039;t had a problem, and I&#039;m quite happy just guess-timating whether I can afford the 93/7 ground beef or just the 80/20.]]></description>

Just told the truth ;) Yeah, the system is the key. I am drafting a post about that too.

I don&#039;t say it cannot worth the work, but I am a realist and I know that sooner or later I would leave out something. And what does it worth if you do not track everything. I have a slight OCD too, maybe that&#039;s the reason :)

Glad to hear that. You know what they say: &quot;The husband is the head of the family, but the wife is the neck&quot;!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for the shout-out and kind words HCF. If you&#039;ve got a functioning system, I say that&#039;s all you need!

I&#039;m glad you liked what you saw in Thrifty. It definitely requires dedication - manual entries take time - and is really geared for the people that find themselves at the end of the month asking &quot;Where did all my money go?&quot;.

Sounds like you and your wife are a great match! Jaime and I are much the same way - she knows how to keep me in check :)]]></description>

Thank you for reading. And for the kind words. It is good to know that I am not alone with this approach. In my opinion to get ahead financially the key is simplification and to keep it real.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[THIS. IS. PRICELESS. It is so true and honest that I feel I could have written something very similar. I also disagree that all roads to financial prosperity begin with a budget. (Such a nasty word, too.) I&#039;m far more focused on what works emotionally. If you are happier and less stressed, you can rise above and make small improvements. If you are stressed and tracking and accounting, you get caught in the weeds. I thoroughly enjoyed this. Thank you!]]></description>
