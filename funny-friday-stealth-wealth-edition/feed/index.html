					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/funny-friday-stealth-wealth-edition/#comment-120&quot;&gt;Cubert&lt;/a&gt;.

I used to have a shitty one back in the days. I am eager to have one once more, just my family vetoed so far :D But the day will come, I know.

I will try this thing, just was not able to get a jar so far. However, inspired by American gastronomy this weekend I made American pancakes for the family the first time. Ok, no maple syrup, but the apricot jam was a good fit too.

Thanks for reading ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha! I had thought about getting a mohawk, but that picture at the end of your post just ruined it for me.

Off now to prep my PB&#038;J for today&#039;s work lunch. :-)]]></description>
