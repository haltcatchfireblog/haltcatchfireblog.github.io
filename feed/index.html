<p><em>This is again not the post I wanted to publish next. It seems I make a habit out of this. Not sure if I can produce anything of value anymore. At least not now. Not in the current situation. Not in my current state of mind. This post will be a burst out of my swirling thoughts. I think I need this to lessen the pressure inside. To prevent an explosion. So don&#8217;t expect anything more structured or sophisticated than a flow of consciousness on this piece of digital paper. A snapshot of my mind. Behold&#8230;</em></p>



<h2>Fear arises</h2>



<p>I am not the doomsday sayer type. Nor am I one who is all ears for any new conspiracy theory. I like to think of myself as a realist. Ok, I am sometimes too optimistic about some topics but we are speaking now in general. When I heard about the outburst of this new epidemic in China I barely raised an eyebrow. Not that I did not feel empathy for those people. I did. I do. Just the whole thing seemed so distant and so unrelated. Another one of their problems which they will probably solve. Then it started to spread steadily.</p>



<p>At that point, I still did not think much about it. But it was always in the back of my mind. Leaving me feeling unease. Then it hit Europe. I did not start running around and shouting that the sky will fall. But the fear did start growing inside. When I expressed my concerns to my friends they still seemed uninterested. Without any fear. Without any concern. Some made a joke out of it. Despite all that, I was not able to let it go. In my gut I felt that this sh*t is serious, why isn&#8217;t anyone taking it seriously? I still don&#8217;t get it.</p>



<p>I started checking the infection maps and numbers multiple times a day. As there appeared more and more red dots and they got closer and closer my mind started to converge towards the emergency state. I realized that the question is not that if it will hit us but when. I realized that the question is not that if we will be affected but how much. I did not expect fast and effective intervention from the government. If better-organized countries with more resources and more developed systems were not able to prevent and/or handle the situation properly then how can I expect that ours will?</p>



<p>This was about when I started to feel flu-like symptoms. Spoiler alert, I am not infected by the coronavirus. At least as far as I know. Still, I have to tell this did not help. As it came it went away on a weekend. Leaving behind an occasional cough and a sneezy nose. Life went on but suspicion remained. I told my wife we should go shopping. That was the point when she checked my temperature because it is pretty rare when I initiate such a thing. Yes, a stocking up tour was long due because of pure leisure and financial concerns. This time I initiated it because of preparation.</p>



<p>This was the time when my wife started to be concerned. After all, there is a dynamic and there are roles in every relationship and in ours, she is the one who is freaking out for things, most of the time I am just meh. The fact that now I was the freaked out one raised her concerns pretty much. So we went shopping. And somehow it felt stupid. We did not buy much stuff but stocked up two weeks&#8217; worth of groceries and other necessary stuff. And the sky still wasn&#8217;t falling.</p>



<p>The situation got more and more serious day by day. The public still was meh. The week passed. We went on another shopping tour, bought back what we consumed and another two weeks&#8217; worth of stuff. Meanwhile, the disease arrived into the country. Interestingly people still were not really much concerned.</p>



<p>I went to the office on Monday. There were still some jokes but the kind which you tell to calm down the situation. It felt that folks started taking it seriously. Company communication followed and as I was still experiencing flu-like symptoms which got a little bit worse again I remained home on Tuesday and started the recommended 14 days just in case. Days went by and the European countries started making tough decisions. Every day another one of them closed partially or totally, borders, cities, airlines, schools, etc. Shit just got really real.</p>



<p>Then Sunday evening came and I did something I did not do since, maybe the NATO bombings. I watched the live broadcast of the Serbian national television. The president held a speech and declared a state of emergency. His face was a mixture of feelings. Exhaustion, fear, anger, and disbelief. I have to tell that I am not really fond of the guy but now he seemed serious. He seemed like he means what he said and he cares about it. And this scared me even more.</p>



<p>You cannot hear me appraise our government and politics much in general but this time they acted faster and more efficiently than I expected. Actually, today they brought, even more, stricter sanctions as people did not take it seriously enough. So here we are today, 16th of March 2020. Borders closed. Schools canceled. All kinds of public activities prohibited. Military and police patrolling and guarding hospitals and other important buildings. A curfew in place for anyone older than 65 risking a fine of €1275 if they leave their homes. Same for the ones who break the rules of mandatory quarantine. And I honestly think this is the right way. An uncomfortable but right way. I hope it won&#8217;t be too little too late.</p>



<h2>Gratitude and doubt arises</h2>



<p>I cannot help but I feel grateful. We are finally debt-free. No more monthly payments. We have a roof above our heads. No rent payable. We have a pantry packed with items that can last at least a month, maybe more. No fear of starving. We have a small emergency fund that can buy us four months of livelihood. No shortage of the essentials. I have a job that is stable, the management is understanding, pays salaries on time (trust me, this is not default in our country) and can be done remotely if needed. Until we have electricity and internet connection life could go on without any serious restrictions. Why do I feel guilty about that?</p>



<p>I think about the folks who aren&#8217;t as lucky as us. The ones who cannot afford to have a stay at home parent. The ones who don&#8217;t have a garden and are enclosed between the four walls with demanding children. The ones whose jobs are evaporating from one moment to another. The ones who are in debt to their eyeballs. The ones who live from paycheck to paycheck. The ones who have no one to rely on. The ones who have to go to work every day despite the situation. The ones who have to risk their lives to help others survive. The ones who are laying on a bed connected to a respiratory machine waiting to get better. I feel their pain. I hear their struggles. And I have to push these thoughts away as I cannot cope with their weight.</p>



<p>This is one of those times when we have to see how fragile is our everyday lifestyle. How much we take luxuries granted. Self-sustaining households were providing the everyday basics for themselves a century ago. Nowadays we are chasing money and take the abundance of supply natural. Consumerism for the win. Are we all pathetic fools? Are we doomed to fail? Will the society inevitably falling apart? Ok, I stop. As I said I am not a doomsday sayer and I don&#8217;t want to become one. Sometimes these questions arise and only time will tell the answers.</p>



<p>Here I sit at my kitchen table in the middle of the night. Disturbed by these thoughts. Thinking about possibilities. Evaluating options and risks. I wrote about some <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/when-necessities-become-luxuries/">serious shit we went through</a> in our lives. But this situation is a metaphoric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_incognita">&#8220;Terra Incognita&#8221;</a>. Unknown land. No one knows how will this fold out. No one knows where does this situation going. No one knows when will it end, how will it form our future and what will it leave behind. What will be the costs? In lives. In money. In economic growth. What will evolve? What will be erased? Will there be dragons? If only I knew the answers&#8230;</p>

<p><em>Another case of instant post writing invoked by <a href="https://thesavingninja.com/category/thought-experiments/">SavingNinjas&#8217; thought experiment</a> asking &#8220;What is the toughest job you have ever performed?</em>&#8220;<em>. Let&#8217;s jump into the middle and let the stream of consciousness flow. </em></p>



<hr>



<p>The wind was chilly.</p>



<p>The coldest December of recent years.</p>



<p>The temperature was below zero all day long.</p>



<p>At least that was my guess as we did not have a chance to experience it.</p>



<p>In the lazy warmth of the factory hall, we did not have any sense of the outer world.</p>



<p>The monotonous sounds of the gigantic machines almost put us into sleep.</p>



<p>This was our third day and the most boring so far.</p>



<p>The kind when you would like to check the clock every minute just to get disappointed by the painfully slow passing of time.</p>



<p>The rolls of damaged plastic were slowly digested by the so-called regranulator.</p>



<p>I walked to the other end where the small white balls were coming out and disappearing in a hole.</p>



<p>Holding a T-shaped piece of metal in my hand I executed the movements my supervisor showed me.</p>



<p>I had no idea what I was doing.</p>



<p>It did not make any sense to me and I saw no use of it.</p>



<p>But I followed the instructions.</p>



<p>I did not have anything better to do anyway.</p>



<p>I was alone in the room and there was another half an hour or so till I had to fill the bags from the tank again.</p>



<p>Good that we only accepted this job for two weeks.</p>



<p>I only remember that we had a goal in mind about what to do with the money we will earn.</p>



<p>Maybe spend on Christmas gifts? Maybe something else, I cannot really recall.</p>



<p>But I remember well our desperation.</p>



<p>Two weeks were left until the winter holidays.</p>



<p>We had our grades closed for the semester and had the blessing of our teachers to leave school early.</p>



<p>The second grade of high school is not that important after all.</p>



<p>My friend and I were testing the waters of student jobs already but so far it meant only handing out flyers.</p>



<p>This was more serious.</p>



<p>Replacing some plastic factory workers who had to take sick-leave before the holidays.</p>



<p>Maybe coincidence. Maybe not.</p>



<p>We had to get up around half-past five in the morning to do our homework and school preparations.</p>



<p>Be in the canteen at seven having breakfast and reach the first class at 7:30.</p>



<p>Then survive the first part of the day, having a hasty lunch, and leave early to reach the bus.</p>



<p>Showing up at the factory reception exactly at 2 PM.</p>



<p>Eight hours later leaving the plant, rushing to the bus, getting back to the dorm, have a modest dinner, take a shower, and fell asleep immediately.</p>



<p>Rinse and repeat for two weeks. </p>



<p>I felt it was a huge commitment but I felt we can tough it out.</p>



<p>On the first day, we had to package palettes of freshly produced plastic foil rolls.</p>



<p>We were doing the work of a machine which got faulty.</p>



<p>They fixed it on the next day so we were sent over to another room.</p>



<p>We had to feed a tall machine.</p>



<p>Two bags with the blue text on them, one with the orange stamp repeating every five minutes.</p>



<p>Staring on the &#8220;flying&#8221; melted plastic in between.</p>



<p>The next day we were moving on again.</p>



<p>My friend was collecting plastic rubbish around the whole factory.</p>



<p>I was receiving it at the regranulator and feeding it into the machine.</p>



<p>This day was the slowest of all.</p>



<p>I think that was the day when I decided that I don&#8217;t want to work in a monotonous, illogical, meaningless job.</p>



<p>Some days I question if I succeeded in this.</p>



<p>An eternity later we were standing at the bus stop again.</p>



<p>Fooling around the bus stop sign.</p>



<p>Its rod was made out of some kind of metal.</p>



<p>If you touched it your hand got frost to it immediately.</p>



<p>For some reason, it popped into my mind that what would happen if I touch it with my tongue.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I was acting faster than thinking.</p>



<p>Realized my huge mistake only when it was too late.</p>



<p>Terrified from the potential consequences I backed off immediately.</p>



<p>This was my second mistake.</p>



<p>I felt the sharp pain immediately on the top of my tongue and the salty taste of blood in my mouth.</p>



<p>It hurt but we were laughing so hard that there were no room for self-pity.</p>



<p>Being able to laugh at your own stupidity can be a lifesaver.</p>



<p>It took about a week for my skin to fully recover.</p>



<p>By the time we left the factory and that job behind, the pain was long gone.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s left is a funny anecdote and the memory of our achievement.</p>



<p>This was the first and toughest job of my life but we survived and excelled it.</p>



<p>I promised myself that if there is a way I will not accept such a mind-numbing and soul-crushing job again.</p>



<p>So far so good&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Foreword: I was planning my return from the recent blogging hiatus for a while. I outlined a couple of posts just did not finish them. It seems I am pretty bad at planning and careful implementation. There is too much to write about and time is too scarce. The last six months were a roller coaster in almost all areas of my life. I will report about these shortly but I fear that if I don&#8217;t get back to writing somehow I risk procrastinating it forever. To get back to my &#8220;write down what&#8217;s in your mind and hit publish&#8221; strategy I was not able to resist the call of <a href="https://thesavingninja.com/the-future-of-work/">SavingNinja&#8217;s</a> latest thought experiment (check out the details and other responses on the link). So, let&#8217;s get back to the business.</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I recently read a statistic that 85% of the jobs there will be in 2030 have not yet been created. What do you think these jobs are, and which ones will no longer exist? What does this mean for education? What will the offices look like in 11 years? Will people continue to commute to a physical office or will remote work and digital nomadism take over? Finally, how do you think this will affect the overall global economic balance?&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>I have to start with the interesting coincidence that I listened to a podcast episode with a Hungarian university professor who is a future researcher while this thought experiment post landed in my inbox. One of his initial statements hit me in the stomach which stated that there is a chance that maybe humanity won&#8217;t be part of the long term future. Putting this disturbing thought away let&#8217;s get back to our eleven-year timeframe and consider the possibilities.</p>



<p>In my opinion, by 2030 the most interesting changes will happen in our day-to-day life, not on the global economic level so forgive me if my focus will wandering away from the future of jobs and offices. What can I say, I am a dreamer in heart. I think that there will be significant improvements but nothing earthshaking. I am a true believer of the &#8220;what could be automated it should be&#8221; principle. The first areas will be the ones where success could be achieved fast. Industrial automation is an ongoing process for more than a century now. We will soon reach the point when ALL hard physical work will be done by machines. As we are still pretty far from producing the super-AI, supervision will be a must-have so there will be a group of physical workers who will be upgraded from actuators to supervisors. Their numbers will be smaller but the ones who have the wits and determination will definitely be able to make this leap forward.</p>



<p>The other field where we will reach top progression is bureaucracy and paperwork. While (most) governments are huge outdated inefficient systems in general, they stepped already on the path to digitalize as much of our data as possible. We already know that the current paper-based and bread fueled system is not sustainable in the long term. In the near future, all of our data will be fed to complex decision-making systems making slothy paper tossing processes redundant. I haven&#8217;t seen a statistic for how much resources could be saved by that (maybe they do not dare to research the field at all?). I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it turns out that running a government with all of its bureaucracy efficiently would require 30% of the currently consumed resources at most. Just imagine, no more waiting in rows, no more file applications, the system would already know if you need something and by the time your need arises your inbox would be blinking with the outcome of the decision made already. Now, that&#8217;s what I call futuristic <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Our homes will be interwoven with technology. Considering the current IoT hype I guess all of our home appliances will be connected to the cloud sending and receiving thousands of megabytes of data every day. Not sure if the toilet which analyses your urine and gives a general health status report first thing in the morning before your brain even wakes up will be a thing by then but I would not mind it. Then you will get every help from your kitchen assistant preparing your healthy breakfast recommended by your nutritionist algorithm. Your mind, freed from thinking about meal-planning and shopping duties (all handled by your smart appliances), can focus on consuming the up to date, relevant information and passing on to your <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html">Belief Bouncer</a> while you are slowly sipping your perfect, machine-made coffee.</p>



<p>Turning the hardware and software of these systems will require a significant amount of participants from the job market, more than there will be available IMO. Also, these folks will not only be techies, coders, and engineers but logical and systematic-thinking professionals from the fields the former have to automate. Their knowledge base and advice will be highly required. I know from my own experience that you can produce valuable applications even without knowing the ins and outs of the industry you producing for. But only with the help of experienced professionals of the targeted field.</p>



<p>Bad news but what is totally sure that we still will have to do some work. Not as much as we used to do back in the times but still, one needs to work to put food on the table, a roof above one&#8217;s head and fire into the hearth. Or do we? Or that general basic income thing will be widely used by then? Anyways, we will probably head to the home office and check our emails. Or voicemails. Or videomails. Not sure. Heading to a physical office will still be a thing but it will be occasional and employees will do it in rounds to be able to use the given space more efficiently and economically. Remote working will be the supported and preferred way of employment, not a suspicious act that employers see as potential slacking time (like many of the does these days).</p>



<p>Optimally we would be looking forward to spending 3-6 hours with focused work. Of course interrupted by virtual meetings (holomeetings?) with colleagues from all over the world. At least real-time translation will be a common thing by then so we do not have to learn all of the dozen languages used by them. Narrow task AI systems will handle the most of our past tasks but you remember, these will still need someone to supervise, fix, deploy and develop them. I was lucky enough to see Garry Kasparov on stage earlier this year and I deeply agree with him.</p>

<p>Wrapping up our workday we will log out, pick up our training bag, and say goodbye to our home. High tech supplements and customized guidance from healthcare algorithms will make the task of remaining healthy easy but our body still needs some old fashioned movement. A self-driving electric taxi will already be summoned to the doorstep. On our way to the training grounds, where we can swim, play team games, or carry out a traditional work-out while socializing with others in real life, we can enjoy the view of the clean and green environment. Passing by the education center the thought will often cross our minds that how lucky today kids are.</p>



<p>The burdensome days of standardized formal education will be gone. Every student is different so will be their study programs based on their individual skillsets and interests. All of them will have access to a huge, highly structured and organized multimedia knowledge base including lectures and books from the top thinkers/scientists/performers of the world. Alongside with any kind of gadgets, instruments, and materials, they need to study. Last but not least a diverse group of dedicated and well-educated mentors will be there to help them with any questions or problems arise on the path. If everything is provided education is happening by itself after all.</p>

<p>Money also will be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj-RRAYLoaM">different kind of animal</a>. I would not say that everyone will be happily spending their <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/pirates-of-the-cryptobbean/">Bitcoins</a> but the future monetary system will definitely be built as a hybrid of present financial principles and cutting edge technology. Bookkeeping, taxation, loans, mortgages, insurance, and investments will be all automated and we will have a handful truly powerful advisor algorithms at hand which educate us and guide us through the process if sometimes we will actually have to choose between two similar/identical options. Maybe alongside with accountants, tax officers, insurance salesman, and brokers money bloggers will be also outdated by then <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Technology pervades every aspect of life, whether we like it or not. In the future, this process will be just accelerated. Some of the above-mentioned things may not be happening in the next eleven years. I am pretty positive about the massive advancement of IoT, gadgets, decision supporter and advisor algorithmic systems everywhere. The transition to electric cars and widespread self-driving vehicles is also inevitable. Governments evolve slowly but reducing costs and working more efficiently will be a must-have in the future so they will be forced to follow the outlined roadmap. The revolution of education is also inevitable if we want to keep up with the changing world at all.</p>



<p>You may argue that I left out my fears from the description but these are kind of more complex than the future of jobs. Pollution, wars, social problems, poverty caused by the mentioned processes. Shortage of resources like water and land. Global warming and extinctions. These are serious problems which we have to solve. While I think that some kind of government and politics will always be in charge I don&#8217;t think that they will solve these problems. As a wise man said, &#8220;we can&#8217;t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them&#8221;. But I believe that civil organizations and forward-thinking companies will provide all the necessary background to make these changes happen. The only question is how much damage will be made in the process and what will be the price we should pay to advance to that next level.</p>

Enjoy!</p>
<h3>Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p>Hello. I’m a blogger who primarily blogs about personal finance. My website is Freedom Is Groovy. My wife and I started the blog in August of 2015 and we go by the monikers Mrs. Groovy and Mr. Groovy, respectively. We haven’t revealed our true identities in order to maintain a bit of privacy.</p>
<h3>Tell us a nerdy secret if you have one</h3>
<p>I’m 57 years old and I’m still intrigued by math. I have a Khan Academy login and I try to do one or two math problems a day. If Mrs.G. would let me, I’d like to take our country’s leading standardized test for college admission again, the SAT.</p>
<h3>When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p>I was in college in the early 80s and my housemate was an engineering student who actually had a personal computer (very rare back then). I don’t know exactly what he did with his PC. It and the software that came with it was very crude. All I know is that he would use his PC to connect to our school’s engineering department over the phone line and our house phone would be out of commission for hours.</p>
<h3>What was your first machine?</h3>
<p>My first PC an Epson (yes, the company primarily known for printers used to make PCs). I bought it in 1986 or 1987, and the hard drive was only 20 megabytes. I couldn’t afford the 40-megabyte hard drive model. Oh, and I bought my first PC because I wanted to write a book.</p>
<h3>Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p>I jumped straight into programming. I worked in a highway department and all the roads we maintained were cataloged in a Word document (we called it the “street dictionary”). Anyway, for a number of reasons I won’t detail here, cataloging our roads in a Word document wasn’t very practical. So I took it upon myself to manual type all the information from our street dictionary into an Access database. Learning Access databases led me to VBA and SQL, and VBA and SQL let me to C++.</p>
<h3>What about education, was it related to computing, did you learn in a traditional way or something else?</h3>
<p>I studied sociology, journalism, and public administration&#8211;nothing related to computers and programming. I got the database and programming bug in the mid-90s and I’m entirely self-taught. Back then I would just buy one database or programming book at a time and just plow through it.</p>
<h3>What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p>I have a BA in sociology, a BS in journalism, and an MPA in public administration.</p>
<h3>When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</h3>
<p>I got my first real job in 1986. As already mentioned before, it was with a highway department on Long Island, New York. I started off as a clerk in the personnel department and eventually got promoted to a construction inspector after passing a civil service exam. About three years into my construction inspector career, I was put in charge of rating all the roads we maintained. Part of this new assignment also meant maintaining the street dictionary I mentioned earlier, and the street dictionary proved to be the impetus of my IT career.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I was the highway department’s IT for over ten years but my titled never changed from a construction inspector. My highway department didn’t have any computer or programming related job titles at the time.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Groovy and I left Long Island in 2006 and relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina, I got my first IT job with an actual IT title. I was a data analyst for a healthcare consultant and I mainly did what I did for the highway department&#8211;create and manage databases and write code.</p>
<h3>What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p>I only worked formally in the IT sector for ten years. And I only worked for one company during that ten year period. And what pleasantly surprised me about this company was that it wasn’t a slave to formal credentials. Most of the IT people in this company had computer science degrees. But at least a third didn’t. All this company cared about were skills. If you had the skills, you would be hired and promoted. It didn’t matter whether you learned those skills in college or on your own. And just for the record, there were four guys at this company that I really looked up to. Their programming skills were off the charts. Two had computer science degrees and two were self-taught.</p>
<h3>What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</h3>
<p>I am currently retired. Mrs. Groovy and I achieved financial independence in 2014 but didn’t retire until October of 2016. We wanted to make sure we entered retirement with a nice cushion.</p>
<h3>Tell us about your journey so far?</h3>
<p>For Mrs. Groovy and me, the key to achieving financial independence was getting out of debt and owning our home outright. Once you have shed the mortgage, the car loan, and the credit card debt, the cost of living is remarkably cheap, especially in the southern portion of the United States. When we became completely debt free and owned our home outright in 2006, we were able to save over half of our gross household income. Save over half of your gross household income for ten years and you’ll have a good chance of achieving financial independence&#8211;providing the stock market doesn’t frown on you, of course. Another key was finding contentment in the ordinary. If you need fancy cars, clothes, electronics, and vacations to secure happiness, you’ll have a very difficult time-saving money and achieving financial independence. Don&#8217;t’ get me wrong. Mrs. Groovy and I appreciate fabulous stuff just like everyone else. In fact, we’re spending five weeks in Australia later this year. But we get just as much joy out of playing cards with family and friends or going out for ice cream on a Saturday night, or reading a good book. Master the art of being happy with less and life will get incredibly easy.</p>
<h3>How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</h3>
<p>Being an IT guy primarily affected my finances by making me a coveted employee. Once I developed top-notch database skills, I had no problem securing employment, promotions, and bonuses. For instance, at my last job, I started off as a data analyst. Then I was promoted to program specialist, and soon after that, I was promoted to program manager. And all because I had a knack for manipulating data, automating tasks, and writing complex SQL.</p>
<h3>Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p>Yes. And it doesn’t take much to see if you have an aptitude for IT field. If you’re a cubicle jockey who primarily answers phone calls and performs data entry, start teaching yourself Excel and Access. And after three months or so of learning the basics of spreadsheets and databases, start trying to automate aspects of your job with Excel, Access, and VBA. It’s a great way to learn something on your boss’s dime and make your job easier. Also, it’s a great way to advance your career. Become good at automating routine office tasks and you will become a very valuable employee.</p>
<h3>Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p>Hell no! My biggest regret is that I didn’t discover databases and programming sooner.</p>
<h3>Tips for beginners?</h3>
<p>Start. Download Notepad++ and start coding with Javascript. Go to the W3School and the Khan Academy and start working through the Javascript tutorials. Once you get comfortable with Javascript, move on to PHP or Python. Finally, you should become familiar with databases and SQL. Backend databases hold the world’s data and once you can communicate with databases via SQL, you have all the world’s data at your fingertips. Very powerful. Download the latest express edition of SQL Server from Microsoft and start honing your SQL skills (the express version is free).</p>
<h3>Which technology area picks your brain most these days?</h3>
<p>I’m out of the IT business these days. I mainly occupy my brain by reading and writing about personal finance. Before I left the workforce in 2016, I was very intrigued by No SQL databases. No SQL databases store data in free-flowing tables. One row might have ten columns and the next row might have twenty columns. Apparently, this kind of storage works better with massive amounts of data than regular SQL databases. You can retrieve your data faster. Anyway, during the last year or so of my career, I started playing around with Mongo, an opensource No SQL database. So if I were still in the IT game today, I would be honing my No SQL skills.</p>
<h3>What do you think is the biggest improvement/challenge the IT industry looking forward these days?</h3>
<p>Today, it’s much easier to teach yourself and prove to potential employers that you have the requisite skills. And you don’t have to be rich to go the DIY route. When I got interested in databases and coding in the 90s, there was no opensource software, no YouTube, no Khan Academy, no GitHub, no high-speed internet, and no blogosphere. I imagine there were some certifications back then, but I don’t recall any. If people wanted to get a worthwhile IT credential, they had to go to college.</p>
<h3>We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</h3>
<p>• Desktop OS: Windows 10<br />
• Mobile OS: Android<br />
• Machine: HP<br />
• Browser: Chrome<br />
• Programming language: SQL (I know. Not really a language, but I’m an SQL junkie.)<br />
• And the most important… spaces or tabs: Tabs</p>
<h3>Would you write a couple of lines of code to present a simple financial principle?</h3>
<pre>Dim curMonthlyExpenses as currency
Dim curMonthlyTakeHomePay as currency
Dim sSQL as string

curMonthlyTakeHomePay = $6000

sSQL = “Select Sum(Amount) From ExpenseLogTable Where Month(ExpenseDate) = 4;”

curMonthlyExpenses = GetMonthlyExpenses(sSQL)

If curMonthlyTakeHomePay - curMonthlyExpenses &gt; 0
    DepositMoneyIntoBrokerageAccount(curMonthlyTakeHomePay - curMonthlyExpenses)
Else
    MsgBox (“You’re spending too much!”)</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, groovy freedomist, that’s all I got. What say you? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><em>(Sorry, but cannot resist stealing your finishing line)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When someone mentions the word &#8220;luxury&#8221; the first things which come into mind are a holiday villa, a Lamborghini, a big pool with a bar serving fancy cocktails, champagne, and caviar. Simple things like tap water, central heating or common cars would probably not appear on that list. Despite these things became common only in the last century we are taking them as granted without a second thought. Then something happens and we are facing an unpleasant reminder that these things are luxuries indeed and can be gone in a blink of an eye. I did experience a couple of these reminders in my lifetime, sometimes because of politics and sometimes because of nature.</p>
<p>I was born in a country which does not exist anymore. It had many names through the decades but you probably knew it simply as Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, I am not old enough to tell tales about the golden years, as I was born about the start of the declension, but the elders say that it had the nickname&nbsp;&#8220;Small America&#8221; amongst the neighbor countries, which tells a lot. Life was good back then but, as usually happens, politicians decided that they want to mess up the things. I don&#8217;t want to go into details if you are interested, have a look&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553038013304000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGFGX_C9TkHzYy4UoCdkM6UGrzFA">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Fuel</h3>
<p>I bet that not many eight-year-olds know what the word &#8220;embargo&#8221; means. Neither did we. Until it&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Yugoslavia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Yugoslavia&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553038013304000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFjQ3vcgUI_coaRfNNcrdaCnVUL0w">happened</a>. The first thing I remember that after the oil export got banned suddenly there was a shortage of fuel. My family owned a canary yellow&nbsp;<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/how-i-fell-in-love-with-hatchbacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.haltcatchfire.com/how-i-fell-in-love-with-hatchbacks/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553038013304000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHFKzkIGtsR7FVq45lu5a_FedIb-g">Yugo Coral 60</a>, thus we were eligible to buy some fuel. The amount was set by the government. The memory lives vividly in my mind. It was a nice warm spring day. I was standing with my father in a long row waiting for the fuel thickets at the local community building. The adults were chatting quietly about politics, jobs or how big was the fish they caught last weekend.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1409 size-full" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/drum-2523833_640-e1553852846716.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="371"></p>
<p>A couple of hours later we left the building with four small pieces of paper the size of a credit card. Each granted the right to buy 5 liters of petrol at the local gas station. That amount had to last for a month. To be totally honest I cannot recall if we used it or simply sold those valuable pieces of paper to those who were more in need of fuel. I&nbsp;don&#8217;t remember the exact numbers as the value of money was <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/three-financial-lessons/">ambiguous back then</a>, but according to the&nbsp;prices I found online, filling that fuel tank would easily cost a monthly salary. We did not really have&nbsp;many places to visit after all&#8230;</p>
<h3>Supplies</h3>
<p>Following the banning of oil import there came a total ban of importing and exporting of any goods. We were lucky as we were living in the northern part of the country where the agriculture was strong and the food supplies were abundant. I don&#8217;t think that we ever had problems with the basic ingredients like flour, sugar, milk,&nbsp;and eggs. However, the other stuff we were used to buying as kids (candy, chocolate, chewing gum, and juice) slowly disappeared from the stores along with many other things. I remember walking around the corner store having a pile of stuff in one shelf and another one a couple of meters away. The whole supply of my hometown would fit into a single supermarket I guess but at least we had food on the table and that is something not everyone in the country was able to state in those times&#8230;</p>
<h3>Electricity</h3>
<p>Fast forward a couple of years and we get to the next conflict the politicians thought a good idea. Exactly twenty years ago, on the 24th of March, we were standing in the schoolyard listening to our teachers telling us that the school will be closed until further notification. We did not really get the situation so with the simple message that school is skipped today, so we simply walked home. I almost arrived home when the first sirens sounded&#8230;</p>
<p>That was the longest summer vacation we ever had. It lasted over five months. Again we were lucky as in the northern area the situation was not that bad. There was a dusk-to-dawn curfew and we&nbsp;had to be alert when the sirens sounded. Apart from that, it was silent, lazy summertime. We did what every other kid to kill time. We played video games. Both I and my best friend had a PC back then and we also were members of a computer club. Why is this important? In those days the country was short on energy supplies. Because of that, there were planned blackouts through the day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1412 size-full" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/light-1030988_640-e1553852976862.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="346"></p>
<p>Sometimes it meant there were eight hours a day when we did not have electricity. Sometimes there were only eight hours when we had. The trick was that our town was divided into several districts and only one had a blackout at a specific time. Our house, my friends&#8217; house, and the computer club were located in three distinct districts so we always had a place for gaming. The transfer of savegame files was a little bit problematic but we solved it. If you are curious about the transfer bandwidth, the top speed was about 2.88 megabyte per minute. You can easily calculate this if you take into account two kids with two bikes, a ten-minute trip and a twenty pack of floppy disks <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Natural Gas</h3>
<p>My next story happened ten years later. This time it was not our country which engaged in international conflict but there was a knockabout between Russia and Ukraine. As a result, they shut the gas tap. We were living in a flat back then which got central heating from the local heating plant which was running on that natural gas. The lack of heating was not a funny thing in the cold January weather. Luckily we had an electric heater which made the situation bearable but it was obvious that it won&#8217;t be a final solution. We were ready to temporarily move back to our hometown where our parents had those good old school wood burning furnaces. It did not happen as after one or two days the heat service providers changed to diesel-fueled heating. The service went on but the smog was horrible in the following days until the conflict ended.</p>
<h3>Water</h3>
<p>The last example was independent of&nbsp;any conflicts or political activity (if you do not take into account the conspiracy theories about weather control machines). Four years ago we moved into our current home. Like many first time buyers, we were inexperienced and wanted to settle down as soon as possible instead of searching for years. After seeing a dozen horrible options we went for the one which we thought good enough. The decision was almost perfect. Almost.</p>
<p>Our new home is located in that area of the city where tap water is not accessible yet. The work of laying down the pipes was in progress by the time in the neighboring streets. Then suddenly they moved on. The circle was not finished so we thought that they will continue the work next spring. They did not. It was not a problem as our home, as all the others around, has a dug well which provides us with running water. Then two years ago one day the running water stopped running.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1410 size-full" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/clean-21479_640-e1553852872315.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="346"></p>
<p>It was exactly the week when my wife and our newborn baby daughter was about to arrive home from the hospital. If you think that your marriage is rock solid and can stand anything I would recommend telling your significant other that after spending a couple of days in a hospital, with no less task than bringing a new life to this world, that she can not have a warm shower and that you have no idea when will the running water return. Success guaranteed <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>A couple of days and a few service brigades later we got know that the water levels dropped in the area. Our well was at a critical depth level and cannot be fixed. Fortunately, our neighbors were helpful and they let us connect our system with their garden tap for a couple of weeks. In the end, we had to get professional help to dig a new well. A couple of weeks and a&nbsp;huge pile of money later the water is running happily ever since but the &#8220;happy&#8221; memories will remain with us forever.</p>
<p>As you can see, things can go south in a blink of an eye. So, when you next start to feel that you need that latest phone or another hundred TV channels, please stay for a moment and think about what are your real necessities in life and once you discover that you are doing well I bet you will start smiling <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><i>Welcome back geeky FIRE seekers. The <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/coders-of-finance/">Coders of Finance</a> series returns for 2019 and we kick off the year with</i>&nbsp;Marc from <a href="https://vitaldollar.com">VitalDollar.com</a>. I just realized browsing the previous episodes that despite we are all coders how different our paths, visions, mindsets, and skillsets are. Marc just raises this diversity further. His way of running his business is truly inspiring and his achievements aren&#8217;t small wins in my opinion. So, Marc please take it over.</em></p>
<h3>Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Marc. I’m 40 years old and I live in Pennsylvania with my wife and our two kids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My experience is different than most of the other people who have been interviewed in this series. I have some experience with web design and development, but most of my experience is related to online business. I got started with web design, but that led to me creating my own websites and blogs. I’ve been managing my own sites/blogs full-time since 2008.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I think of myself as an online entrepreneur first, an interest in web design was really what started it all. I used to design and code custom WordPress themes and websites for small businesses, both for clients and to create and maintain my own websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ran a web design blog from 2007 &#8211; 2013 (more on that in a minute) so I worked in the industry even though I wasn’t taking that many client projects for most of those years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the web design blog, I’ve also had blogs on photography, travel, and now finance. </span><a href="https://vitaldollar.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VitalDollar.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a personal finance blog, is my current project.</span></p>
<h3><b>Tell us a nerdy secret if you have one</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think my secret is that I don’t have a whole lot in common with most developers. My background is in business and what really attracted me to web design and development was the possibility of being able to create my own websites in order to make money. I saw the entrepreneurial side of it, and that led me to an interest in learning how to code.</span></p>
<h3><b>When was your first encounter with computing?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My parents had a desktop computer when I was pretty young (I guess it was in the mid-80’s). I used it to play games. I had a baseball game that I loved to play, and there was also some horse racing game that was a lot of fun betting on fake horses. I remember the graphics were terrible. It looked like little chairs moving, nothing like horses. Looking back, I guess I’m kind of fortunate that I didn’t develop a gambling addiction. </span></p>
<h3><b>What about education, was it related to computing, did you learn in a traditional way or something else? What kind of degree do you have?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My degree is in Business Administration, but in my last semester I took an elective course on web design and I really loved it. The course was very basic HTML and some graphics. By the end of the course, we were able to create a basic table-based website (this was back in 2002).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That course really got me interested, and since I was majoring in business I saw the potential in being able to code my own websites as business experiments. After college, I continued to learn on my own by reading books and following online tutorials. I had to learn CSS because the course didn’t cover that at all. I played around creating some websites of my own just to learn, although I don’t think any of those websites went live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2006, I started doing some web design for friends and family that had small businesses. I enjoyed it and I needed some extra money, so in 2007 I decided to try to expand and find clients from outside of my personal network. I set up a portfolio website and a blog to try to attract traffic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That blog took off really quickly. It did help me to land some clients, but I realized I didn’t really like the client work, and I actually liked working on my own blog more. I decided to shift my focus, and from then on my blog content targeted other web designers, rather than potential clients for my services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the target audience of my blog was other designers, I did get a decent number of potential clients contacting me through the site. I didn’t take on a lot of client work, but if there was a project that looked like a good fit, I would pursue it. It was mostly websites for small businesses and non-profit organizations, including a few churches. Most of them were custom WordPress themes, but I did do a few static HTML websites for clients, and I worked with a few other content management systems, like LightCMS.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1347" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/workstation-405768_1920.jpg" alt="Workstation" width="1920" height="1294"></p>
<h3><b>When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I graduated from college in 2002, and I worked in a few different jobs in the finance industry from 2002 &#8211; 2008. Although I always had work, I struggled to find a job that I liked. I wanted something that would give me a chance to grow and develop, but everything just seemed like a dead end job. That’s really what led me to start my web design and blogging side hustle in 2007.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2008, about 1.5 years after starting my blog, I was able to leave my job and pursue my own business full-time. At that point I was making some advertising revenue from my blog, doing some freelance writing for other web design blogs, and a small amount of client work for web design and website maintenance.</span></p>
<h3><b>What are your experiences about the industry?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve never worked as an employee in the industry. I did some freelance work for a few years, and I’ve also managed my own websites and blogs since 2007. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a web design blog, of course, I had plenty of contact with other web designers and developers. I always enjoyed getting to know other people in the industry, and I found designers and developers to be very welcoming.</span></p>
<h3><b>Are you still coding?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not really. The extent of my coding now is limited to some small customizations to the styling of WordPress themes, or maybe some opt-in forms. I always coded my own sites up until about 2014. Running my own sites kept me busy enough that I didn’t have time to really get practice and stay up-to-date with trends when mobile browsing became a lot more popular. Another factor was that premium WordPress themes were getting easier to customize, so for the past few years, it has made more sense for me to use available themes rather coding from scratch. When I started coding responsive themes it was taking me too long. With plenty of WordPress themes available, it just seemed unnecessary to do it myself.</span></p>
<h3><b>How has the ability to code impacted your business?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My business started when I was doing freelance web design work, so it never would have started without coding. My interest in design and development allowed me to grow a successful blog that gave me a great start to my career and had a big impact on my family’s finances.</span></p>
<h3><b>What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I are hoping to be able to retire early, but not exceptionally early. She has been a stay-at-home mom since our daughter was born in 2012. We hope that she’ll be able to work with me in a few years once our son starts school (our daughter is in kindergarten this year).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to be able to retire by the time our youngest graduates from high school, which should be about 15 years from now. I would be about 55, and my wife would be about 53. We’re on track to reach those goals, but in the world of self-employment, you really never know what might happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t view financial independence quite the same as some other people in the FI community. I don’t think 25x our annual expenses is enough for either my wife or I to feel freedom over money. To me, the whole point of financial freedom is the actual feeling and relief of not needing to worry about money. Our goal is to have 50x our current annual expenses, which I should allow both us to truly feel that freedom. Right now we’re about halfway there.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1348" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/keyboard-338505_1920.jpg" alt="Camera" width="1920" height="1271"></p>
<h3><b>Tell us about your journey so far?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My 20’s were pretty much a waste financially. Like I mentioned earlier, I wasn’t able to find a job that I liked, and my income was on the lower side all the way through my 20’s. I started my web design and blogging side hustle when I was 28 and left my full-time job right when I turned 30. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, my 30’s were much more productive years. I was able to have some success with the web design blog that originally started as a side hustle. I managed that blog for several years before I sold it in 2013 for $500,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, I had a few different photography blogs that I started. I’ve sold those blogs now (you can read on my blog about </span><a href="https://vitaldollar.com/how-to-make-money-from-hobby/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how I turned a photography hobby into more than $1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), but they were a lot of fun to manage for a few years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I’m focusing on growing Vital Dollar, although I also have a few small </span><a href="https://vitaldollar.com/build-a-niche-website/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">niche websites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><b>How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think my profession has significantly impacted my finances. When I started my own business our financial situation wasn’t that great. We weren’t in debt, aside from a mortgage, but we were saving enough money to reach our goals. We managed our money pretty well, but our income wasn’t high enough to allow us to meet aggressive goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I started my own business, my income has been significantly higher. My wife was able to leave her job, which never would have been possible on my old income. We’ve also been able to grow our net worth, </span><a href="https://vitaldollar.com/realities-of-mortgage-free-living/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay off our mortgage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and give ourselves a shot at reaching our early retirement goals.</span></p>
<h3><b>Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would definitely recommend an online business for anyone who is interested, and willing to put in the work. It wasn’t easy and took some sacrifices early on, but it has paid off. I love being able to work from home and choose the projects that I work on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the coders out there, personal projects and side hustles are a great way to get started with entrepreneurship.</span></p>
<h3><b>We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Desktop OS &#8211; Mostly PC, but I also have a Mac. I don’t really have a preference, I just have more experience with PC and they’re cheaper, so that’s what I typically use. On my photography blogs I sold some downloadable products that were basically software add-ons, so I have both so I could test my products.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mobile OS &#8211; Android. I’ve never used anything else.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Browser &#8211; Mostly Chrome, but I also use Firefox. There are a few Chrome extensions that I use a lot, so that’s the main reason I stay mostly in Chrome.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Thank you, Marc, that you have shared your journey with us. All of us can learn something from you. Many coders are just dreaming about dedicating themselves to their own projects full-time. Of course, it is not without reason as a huge percentage of startups fail pretty quickly. Playing it safe and starting something on the side is always a good idea and still lets you test the waters.</em></p>
<p><em>What do you think? Which would bring more success to a coder as an entrepreneur, business skills or technical skills, or both on an equal level? Share your thoughts with us in the comments.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, dear reader, you have read it right. That&#8217;s my question. As many of you know, despite I live in Serbia I am a Hungarian guy and count Hungary as my homeland too. Thus, every sometimes, when I cheat on my low information diet I follow the news over there. Last week the Hungarian prime minister <a href="https://bbj.hu/politics/orban-reveals-radical-family-support-package_161331">revealed a radical family support package</a>&nbsp;as part of their action plan to prevent the demographic decrease.</p>
<p>I am not really <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/three-financial-lessons/">involved in politics</a> and have limited knowledge of economics so won&#8217;t go into any detailed analysis or debate about the political or economic background or rationality of this package. Instead, I thought it would be fun to play the &#8220;what if&#8221; game and&nbsp;run a thought experiment using the numbers which were the just presented. As the system is pretty complicated and has many restrictions for many situations I will only walk through an ideal use case.</p>
<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the following assumptions to sketch up the most ideal situation to take advantage of these benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a newlywed couple and this is their first marriage.</li>
<li>The wife is in the middle of her twenties and has spent a little more than three years in the workforce.</li>
<li>They have no kids yet but the wife is already pregnant.</li>
<li>They have plans on having a family with three kids in the next ten years.</li>
<li>Both of them are employed and to make it simply they have no debt.</li>
<li>Even better if the wife has student loans, as in case of having three kids the loan could be forgiven.</li>
<li>They are renting currently but their biggest dream is to move into their own family home.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is our basic setup, a very typical one I think.</p>
<h3>Initialization</h3>
<p>According to the newly presented information every young mother who agrees (don&#8217;t have to be pregnant or have kids already) to give birth in the following five years would be granted an interest-free general purpose personal loan of 10 million Hungarian forints (about $35.436).</p>
<p>Moreover, because of the Home Purchase Subsidy Scheme for Families, known by its Hungarian acronym &#8220;CSOK&#8221;&nbsp;they are eligible for another 10 million HUF (about $35.436) as a non-refundable grant in case they sign that they will have three kids in ten years (both giving birth an adopting is an option).</p>
<p>Because of the &#8220;CSOK&#8221; they are eligible for a government-supported mortgage of 15 million HUF&nbsp;(about $53.170) with a fixed 3% interest rate. The common mortgages on the market have an interest rate of about 5%. We pick a 20-year contract with a fixed interest rate throughout the whole period.</p>
<p>Our couple signs up for all these benefits and after searching diligently they find their&nbsp;dream home, a newly built turnkey house with all the necessary appliances included at the ticket price of 35 million HUF ( about $124.000). Maybe this sounds too low, but if you are not looking for a home in the capital area it is pretty realistic.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1323" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/new_home.jpg" alt="New Home" width="640" height="411"></p>
<h3>The first</h3>
<p>They decide to use all the &#8220;free&#8221; money on the purchase and they happily move in. By the time the paybacks start to kick in it is about the time their first child is born. Thus the payback of the personal loan gets suspended for three years.</p>
<p>They only have to start paying back the 15 million mortgage which means a monthly payment of about $300. This beats the available rents in the area so they are already very happy. I am sure this would make even getting used to sleep-deprivation easier <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><em>Personal loan amount: 10 million (payback suspended for 3 years)</em></p>
<p><em>Mortgage amount: 15 million ($300 monthly payment)</em></p>
<h3>The second</h3>
<p>Fast forward two years, they paid back 25 monthly payments reducing the mortgage amount with about 2 million ($7500). They discover that the wife is expecting a baby again. Nine months later she gives birth to their second child.</p>
<p>Both their family and financial life gets enlightened. The personal loan payback gets suspended for another three years, moreover, the loan amount gets reduced by 30%.</p>
<p>Through another grant at the time of the birth of their second child 1 million HUF gets deducted from the mortgage amount.</p>
<p><em>Personal loan amount: 7 million&nbsp;(payback suspended for 3 years)</em></p>
<p><em>Mortgage amount: 12 million ($300 monthly payment)</em></p>
<h3>The third</h3>
<p>The kids are growing fast. Our couple is about to celebrate the fifth and second birthdays of their kids when they learn that they are expecting a baby again. Nine months later happiness is all over the place when their third cute and perfectly healthy baby sees the light of the sun.</p>
<p>The government is exceptionally happy too as the demographic numbers are getting better and better so they pour the last round of grants on them. The personal loan gets erased in its wholeness.</p>
<p>The 10 million grant is secured and they are getting another deduction on their mortgage amount. This time the amount is 4 million. Through the last two years they paid back 2 million again so this amount gets deducted from the remaining 10 million.</p>
<p><em>Personal loan amount: 0 (entirely forgiven)</em></p>
<p><em>Mortgage amount: 6 million ($300 monthly payment)</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1324" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/three_kids.jpg" alt="Three kids" width="640" height="427"></p>
<h3>Killing it</h3>
<p>At this point, we can assume that if they were saving and investing in the past ten years they could kill the remaining mortgage in a blink of an eye. Same time the interest rate is pretty low so looking on just the numbers, it is probably a better idea to keep saving and investing and just paying off the mortgage in the next ten years using the proceeds.</p>
<p>Also worth mentioning that after&nbsp;living in the house for ten years they are allowed to sell it (capital gain tax-free), pay off the rest of the mortgage and cash out if they decide so. Taking a hypothetical 3% appreciation into account they could probably sell the home for about 47 million. Let&#8217;s deduct 6 million for killing the mortgage and another 1 million for the expenses. They will end up at 40 million HUFs, almost $142k in the bank versus the $36k they paid back.</p>
<h3>Let&#8217;s ride</h3>
<p>I have to add that a family of five has its needs. For example, one could be a car which is big enough to carry around all of them with their stuff. Luckily, the government got your back again.</p>
<p>For a family with three kids, they throw at you another non-refundable grant of 2.5 million HUFs in case you buy a brand new car which has at least seven seats. Let&#8217;s pick the cheapest solution and go with the not very appealing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacia_Lodgy">Dacia Lodgy</a>. But hey, a car is a car, am I right? It gets you from point A to point B. Who cares how does it look like?</p>
<p>The list price for that monster is around 3.5 million HUFs. That means they only have to save up 1 million ($3.550) to have a brand new car. Sounds good, right?</p>
<h3>Closing words</h3>
<p>Of course, this is a best-case scenario. Most of the times life happen on the way.&nbsp;Still, it is a good example of how can one family kickstart their life by obtaining a $124k home for less than one-third of the ticket price and max out the benefits the government offers them legally.</p>
<p>You could say that &#8220;Yeah, sounds good, but those kids cost money too&#8221;. Well, that is true but you probably would not make such a choice based only on the benefits. Or at least I would not. So, I assume our lovely couple could afford to raise them anyway. One of the biggest expenses, education could be free in Hungary after all. Also, there are other grants a family could get but those are out of the scope of this already long post.</p>
<p><em>Hope you enjoyed this little thought experiment. Does your government offer something similar? Are they crazy? Would you take advantage of such benefits? Would it trick you into having more kids than you should have? What are your thoughts?</em></p>

<blockquote><p>“So many books, so little time.”<br />
―&nbsp;<span class="authorOrTitle">Frank Zappa</span></p></blockquote>
<p>This little quote sums up pretty much my recent years. I love reading books but I have to admit that in the past two years I consumed written content mostly in form of blog posts. I am not a fan of <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wrapping-up-the-year-with-gratitude/">new years resolutions</a> so the decision that in 2019 I want to read more actual books is more of a plan. When I saw that one of the first bloggers I started to follow wrote a book and offering a copy for review I knew that I will take the challenge to write my first book review. Enjoy.</p>
<h3>The Proven Path To All The Money You Will Ever Need</h3>
<p>I think that I don&#8217;t really have to introduce <a href="https://twitter.com/sabatier">Grant Sabatier</a> from <a href="https://millennialmoney.com/">MillennialMoney.com</a> to anyone who spent a couple of months in the personal finance blogosphere&#8230; Still, if you don&#8217;t know him yet, don&#8217;t worry, he is starting the book by introducing you to his story. Despite he followed the proven path of the previous generations (go&nbsp;to good schools, learn well, get good grades, etc.) somehow still ended up broke moving back to his parents&#8217; home. But unlike many other folks, this situation did not push him into the abyss of self-pity and desperation but invoked a thought process which resulted in crossing the finish line of being financially independent&nbsp;five years later. I will not spoiler the details here, give the book a chance, definitely worth a read.</p>

<h3>Who should read this book?</h3>
<p>I would state that everyone who wants to improve his/her financial future but I have to admit that for some reading it would be more important. The main target audience and the ones who need to hear these things the most are millennials in their twenties and thirties who are just at the beginning of their financial journey. It is not the case that older, family folks, like myself, will not find any valuable ideas (spoiler alert: you will) but that age group is the one I think can profit the most from getting familiar with the content of this book. Sneakers and wantrepreneurs, you should also read this book from cover to cover <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>What is the book about after all?</h3>
<p>Well, it is about financial freedom, and financial freedom is about getting back your time and freedom. If I had to summarize it in one sentence I would say:</p>
<blockquote><p>This book is a blueprint, made of all kind of essential financial wisdom, glued together with Grants story and financial journey and infused by a true millennial mindset.</p></blockquote>
<p>The book begins with the statement that &#8220;Money is freedom&#8221; and introducing the authors&#8217; background and epiphany. Then he goes on explaining why should we all participate in the chasing of our freedom through reaching financial freedom.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we start to get involved, and in our first task Grant shows how to calculate our number which would mark the finish line. But the goal is not enough, first, we have to investigate where we are standing at the moment. He gives a very detailed framework to analyze our situations and to get a clear picture of our snapshot.</p>
<p>From now on we can dive into our numbers and make a lot of calculations which will deepen our understanding even better. Then he starts to sketch up the possible advancements in the ways we are making (or saving) money. After an introduction to a proper and comfortable budgeting process, we get to the part where we get embraced to stick to our 9-to-5 jobs, maximize the benefits of it and use it as a launching pad to freedom.</p>

<p>Next, we are getting educated on how to find, establish and run a successful side hustle to fast track the financial advancement. In the next chapter, he walks us through his 7-step investment strategy which pretty much covers the tidbits any average Joe should know and use. Of course, real estate investing cannot be left out.</p>
<p>When the path is clear and you stick to the progress you finally start to get close to your target. You will find the necessary help in the last two chapters to plan how to use your well deserved accumulated wealth and finally a little eye opener/focus keeper philosophy which will make you understand that while money is important it is the tool, not the goal. When you understand this you will live the &#8220;Rich Life&#8221; you always dreamed of.</p>
<h3>My key takeaways from the book</h3>
<p>It turned out that we are thinking about many things very similarly with Grant, mainly on life philosophy and about <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/my-stuff-evaluation-ruleset/">owning stuff</a>. If you are like me, lurking in the personal finance blogosphere and consuming blog posts on a daily basis, possibly you will be familiar with most of the topics covered in this book. Still, there are messages which cannot be repeated enough times so here are the points I found exceptionally interesting.</p>
<ul>
<li>The relationship between time and money should not be linear. We should learn the &#8220;enterprise mindset&#8221; and apply it to our finances. The sooner you can break that linearity the faster you can reach your financial goals.</li>
<li>The main role of a financial advisor is not to bring stellar return opportunities to you but to prevent you from making the dumbest decisions on the most important fields of your financial life.</li>
<li>The understanding of this simple truth: $1 invested will worth more tomorrow, $1 not invested will&nbsp;worth less. That inflation thing truly ruins everything, still, many folks just ignore it like as it isn&#8217;t existing.</li>
<li>Not meeting budgeting goals can make you feel guilty.&nbsp;Budgeting is a lot like dieting: the more guilt you feel, the less likely you are to stick with it&#8230; (explains why I hate budgeting too)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are possibly many more but these were the ones I cannot resist highlighting <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
