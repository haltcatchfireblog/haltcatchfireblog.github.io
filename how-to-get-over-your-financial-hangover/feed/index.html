					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haltcatchfire.com/how-to-get-over-your-financial-hangover/#comment-196&quot;&gt;Sean @ Frugal Money Man&lt;/a&gt;.

So true. Was facing this several times and I was not always the winner. Partly that was my reason staring this blog to keep myself accountable and on track.
That&#039;s an important part of improvement and it is not so easy indeed. One of my friends called it &quot;slaying the energy vampires&quot;.
Thanks for reading, Sean!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Facing The Problem&quot;

Always so easy in theory, yet so difficult to actually do. The majority know there may be a problem, and initially get excited to address the problem. Then the enthusiasm typically fades once they get into their normal routine again. 

It&#039;s never easy to change, especially in an area that you don&#039;t think there is a problem. I have found that an easier way to do this is by tightening your inner circle, and phase out those who bring out the worst in you. It is difficult at first, but never regrettable in the the long run.

Great post!]]></description>
