					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haltcatchfire.com/coders-of-finance-kickoff/#comment-154&quot;&gt;Cashflow Cop&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey, everyone starts somewhere. I know people who started coding when they were five. Also, who were fifty. Does not matter if it really interests you. I have a friend who changed careers and became a coder from a physics teacher. There are parents who started learning how to code to join their kids in Arduino/raspberry pi projects or to teach them how to use Sketch. I think technology is a big digital playground where anyone can find something interesting. Thanks for reading and for the compliment, I will try my best keeping at it ;)]]></description>

Thank you. Good assumptions. Apparently, we have a lot of coders in our ranks. Probably, even more, are just lurking around and never write a comment :) Constant optimization should be a basic concept in life not just for coders, but for everyone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not a coder, more of a novice undercover geek if there is such a thing.  Someone who tries to play around with a few techy things, but in all honesty haven&#039;t got a clue but enjoy the process of discovery nonetheless.  I like how you write and find the posts I have read so far really interesting.  I&#039;ll be stopping by every so often so keep doing what you&#039;re doing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats for starting the series. I suspect there are many coders in the FIRE world probably because they constantly try to analyze and find an efficient way to solve problems in their jobs. Higher salaries don&#039;t hurt on that way either.]]></description>

I truly believe that in that case coding can be even bigger fun :) Also, as I said, time will come when coding will be like writing today. Not everyone will be doing it professionally, but everyone will know to how to do it on a common level. Raspberry PIs are awesome, I would like one too, just was not able to rationalize the purchase to my wife :)]]></description>

Wow, it seems you were more advanced than me. In the C64 era I was only playing games and learning the basics of coding, only years later when I had a PC started hacking them, but don&#039;t remember ever fixing a bug to finish a game, so kudos to you! Thanks for reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great concept HaltCatchFire.

The talk of C64 computers with tape drives in the 80s brings back memories. I spent way too many hours on one teaching myself how to hack games to give myself extra lives, or fix coding bugs so I can actually finish the game!]]></description>
