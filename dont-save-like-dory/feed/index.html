Sorry for hearing that. It is good that you can handle your condition with humor. Kudos to you as I am sure living in such a situation is not an easy task. Sometimes I forget things totally which I agreed to do (for my wife most of the times) and even those are awkward situations :) Thanks for you comment!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had this weird one in a million harmless thing called TGA, transient global amnesia, and it made me into Dory.  You know who you are and how to function as yourself but you lose the ability to store short term memories for a couple of hours.  So you really live in the moment but later you never remember a thing that happened for those two hours.  Anyway, after that I really identify with her.  Where am I anyway?]]></description>
