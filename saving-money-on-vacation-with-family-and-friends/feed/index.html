Thanks, Matt. Unfortunately, that is true. We have less credit card debt over here, but also fewer opportunities :(
That point is the most important one. Don&#039;t know about others but if someone provides me with something I am happy to do something in return. These always should be win-win situations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Enjoyed the post.  Most travel saving posts I see are about travel hacking with credit card points. Those living in Europe don&#039;t have these same options.   My favorite tip is don&#039;t be an asshole.  I&#039;m always stunned when I help someone out and they complain about something trivial or refuse to share in the work/expenses.]]></description>
