<p><em>This is again not the post I wanted to publish next. It seems I make a habit out of this. Not sure if I can produce anything of value anymore. At least not now. Not in the current situation. Not in my current state of mind. This post will be a burst out of my swirling thoughts. I think I need this to lessen the pressure inside. To prevent an explosion. So don&#8217;t expect anything more structured or sophisticated than a flow of consciousness on this piece of digital paper. A snapshot of my mind. Behold&#8230;</em></p>



<h2>Fear arises</h2>



<p>I am not the doomsday sayer type. Nor am I one who is all ears for any new conspiracy theory. I like to think of myself as a realist. Ok, I am sometimes too optimistic about some topics but we are speaking now in general. When I heard about the outburst of this new epidemic in China I barely raised an eyebrow. Not that I did not feel empathy for those people. I did. I do. Just the whole thing seemed so distant and so unrelated. Another one of their problems which they will probably solve. Then it started to spread steadily.</p>



<p>At that point, I still did not think much about it. But it was always in the back of my mind. Leaving me feeling unease. Then it hit Europe. I did not start running around and shouting that the sky will fall. But the fear did start growing inside. When I expressed my concerns to my friends they still seemed uninterested. Without any fear. Without any concern. Some made a joke out of it. Despite all that, I was not able to let it go. In my gut I felt that this sh*t is serious, why isn&#8217;t anyone taking it seriously? I still don&#8217;t get it.</p>



<p>I started checking the infection maps and numbers multiple times a day. As there appeared more and more red dots and they got closer and closer my mind started to converge towards the emergency state. I realized that the question is not that if it will hit us but when. I realized that the question is not that if we will be affected but how much. I did not expect fast and effective intervention from the government. If better-organized countries with more resources and more developed systems were not able to prevent and/or handle the situation properly then how can I expect that ours will?</p>



<p>This was about when I started to feel flu-like symptoms. Spoiler alert, I am not infected by the coronavirus. At least as far as I know. Still, I have to tell this did not help. As it came it went away on a weekend. Leaving behind an occasional cough and a sneezy nose. Life went on but suspicion remained. I told my wife we should go shopping. That was the point when she checked my temperature because it is pretty rare when I initiate such a thing. Yes, a stocking up tour was long due because of pure leisure and financial concerns. This time I initiated it because of preparation.</p>



<p>This was the time when my wife started to be concerned. After all, there is a dynamic and there are roles in every relationship and in ours, she is the one who is freaking out for things, most of the time I am just meh. The fact that now I was the freaked out one raised her concerns pretty much. So we went shopping. And somehow it felt stupid. We did not buy much stuff but stocked up two weeks&#8217; worth of groceries and other necessary stuff. And the sky still wasn&#8217;t falling.</p>



<p>The situation got more and more serious day by day. The public still was meh. The week passed. We went on another shopping tour, bought back what we consumed and another two weeks&#8217; worth of stuff. Meanwhile, the disease arrived into the country. Interestingly people still were not really much concerned.</p>



<p>I went to the office on Monday. There were still some jokes but the kind which you tell to calm down the situation. It felt that folks started taking it seriously. Company communication followed and as I was still experiencing flu-like symptoms which got a little bit worse again I remained home on Tuesday and started the recommended 14 days just in case. Days went by and the European countries started making tough decisions. Every day another one of them closed partially or totally, borders, cities, airlines, schools, etc. Shit just got really real.</p>



<p>Then Sunday evening came and I did something I did not do since, maybe the NATO bombings. I watched the live broadcast of the Serbian national television. The president held a speech and declared a state of emergency. His face was a mixture of feelings. Exhaustion, fear, anger, and disbelief. I have to tell that I am not really fond of the guy but now he seemed serious. He seemed like he means what he said and he cares about it. And this scared me even more.</p>



<p>You cannot hear me appraise our government and politics much in general but this time they acted faster and more efficiently than I expected. Actually, today they brought, even more, stricter sanctions as people did not take it seriously enough. So here we are today, 16th of March 2020. Borders closed. Schools canceled. All kinds of public activities prohibited. Military and police patrolling and guarding hospitals and other important buildings. A curfew in place for anyone older than 65 risking a fine of €1275 if they leave their homes. Same for the ones who break the rules of mandatory quarantine. And I honestly think this is the right way. An uncomfortable but right way. I hope it won&#8217;t be too little too late.</p>



<h2>Gratitude and doubt arises</h2>



<p>I cannot help but I feel grateful. We are finally debt-free. No more monthly payments. We have a roof above our heads. No rent payable. We have a pantry packed with items that can last at least a month, maybe more. No fear of starving. We have a small emergency fund that can buy us four months of livelihood. No shortage of the essentials. I have a job that is stable, the management is understanding, pays salaries on time (trust me, this is not default in our country) and can be done remotely if needed. Until we have electricity and internet connection life could go on without any serious restrictions. Why do I feel guilty about that?</p>



<p>I think about the folks who aren&#8217;t as lucky as us. The ones who cannot afford to have a stay at home parent. The ones who don&#8217;t have a garden and are enclosed between the four walls with demanding children. The ones whose jobs are evaporating from one moment to another. The ones who are in debt to their eyeballs. The ones who live from paycheck to paycheck. The ones who have no one to rely on. The ones who have to go to work every day despite the situation. The ones who have to risk their lives to help others survive. The ones who are laying on a bed connected to a respiratory machine waiting to get better. I feel their pain. I hear their struggles. And I have to push these thoughts away as I cannot cope with their weight.</p>



<p>This is one of those times when we have to see how fragile is our everyday lifestyle. How much we take luxuries granted. Self-sustaining households were providing the everyday basics for themselves a century ago. Nowadays we are chasing money and take the abundance of supply natural. Consumerism for the win. Are we all pathetic fools? Are we doomed to fail? Will the society inevitably falling apart? Ok, I stop. As I said I am not a doomsday sayer and I don&#8217;t want to become one. Sometimes these questions arise and only time will tell the answers.</p>



<p>Here I sit at my kitchen table in the middle of the night. Disturbed by these thoughts. Thinking about possibilities. Evaluating options and risks. I wrote about some <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/when-necessities-become-luxuries/">serious shit we went through</a> in our lives. But this situation is a metaphoric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_incognita">&#8220;Terra Incognita&#8221;</a>. Unknown land. No one knows how will this fold out. No one knows where does this situation going. No one knows when will it end, how will it form our future and what will it leave behind. What will be the costs? In lives. In money. In economic growth. What will evolve? What will be erased? Will there be dragons? If only I knew the answers&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all,&nbsp;by FIREplace I meant the place where you retire to. I bet your instinctive answer to this question would be a huge YES. Also, probably you are already envisioning yourself enjoying the sun on a sandy beach in Spain, France or Italy. Or maybe you prefer indulging into the great fun what a capital city like London could offer? Or even would you just spend your time wandering around in the Alps in Switzerland or Germany? Riding a bike in Netherland or sweating in a sauna in Sweden? The list could go on and on. To be honest I cannot blame you and probably you are right.</p>
<p>But I want to discuss a different area today. We are heading to the eastern parts. As you may know, <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/escaping-the-matrix/">I am living in northern Serbia</a> so we will discuss local options. The numbers could be identical or pretty similar at least for other areas in the neighborhood. Narrow down this area to the places I know about from experience so let&#8217;s say my statements stand for Vojvodina (Serbia), Hungary and Transylvania (Romania).</p>
<p>Now it’s a fact that in the latest years this area is a not the place what comes to mind when you are thinking about where to move. People are leaving these ends in dozens every day searching for a better life in western Europe. I could not really point to a single family around here which does not have a member or a friend (or more) who works and lives abroad. The great majority is driven by financial reasons others by political or simply lifestyle preferences. Can not blame them, this area is not the best place for the average Joe for hoarding wealth. I would lie if I’d say I have never been tempted to leave. To be honest I am thinking about that option every now and then.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-991" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hitcher-1536748_1920-1024x681.jpg" alt="Hitcher" width="640" height="426"></p>
<p>Same time I always see people (unfortunately in very small numbers) who after living abroad for many long years finally gets defeated by homesickness and return to here. While that is a huge driving force there are other benefits of returning to the homeland after you have a steady pension or sufficient savings. In comparison to the states or even western Europe, this is a low-cost area.</p>
<p>Needs and wants in early retirement are very subjective things and highly affected by the lifestyle you used to live. I cannot promise that this area can provide you with everything, so for the sake of this thought experiment let’s assume that you are satisfied with what our little country could offer at other fields of life and let’s focus on the numbers. I will try to summarize the basic financial needs for living in the area looking for multiple options for spending ranges. So let&#8217;s see the &#8220;big three&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Housing</h2>
<p>There is the eternal debate of renting or buying but we will not cover that now. There are too many variables for every situation so let&#8217;s get some examples for both.&nbsp;This place is no different than others, the rental prices are highly dependent on the location and the type of the property.</p>
<h3>Renting</h3>
<p>If you are ok with living in the countryside you can find cheap accommodation in villages or small towns. The only problem here is to find a suitable property (the renting out culture is not that widely spread here). There is a chance that you will not find a flat in such areas but if you can find a house for rent you can probably get it for $70-$150/month. I heard about folks who were able to get a rental and not paying a dime for it just taking care of the place (while the owners were working abroad).</p>
<p>Small-medium sized cities are a little bit more expensive but also could offer more entertainment by the western standards. There is a chance that you can choose from a bigger assortment. From real-life examples, I could say that you can find a studio apartment (around 375sqft) for $100-$150, a medium-sized (around 540sqft) for $150-$300, and a big one (above 1000sqft) for $300-$500 per month. Rental houses are not as frequent here as they should be (trust me we were searching for one with no luck) but where you can find some the prices would be similar to flat rentals only houses can be found at more distant locations.</p>
<p>Big cities are the ones which I would avoid at any costs, but if you insist and want to find a reasonable and acceptable flat you would probably shell out similar amounts as in the western countries. The variability is so high that I would not even try to guesstimate exact numbers, but it could be anywhere above $500 and the sky is the limit.</p>
<h3>Buying</h3>
<p>Following the same distinction at smaller places, you can find properties for even a couple thousand dollars. I heard about whole farms which were bought for less than $10k (taxes and other expenses included). A good estimation for average house prices at these places is on the $10k-$30k scale depending on the size.</p>
<p>In medium-sized cities, flat prices vary from $750-$1250 per square meter (10sqft). Seemingly the real estate market is growing finally, there are a dozen constructions going on just in our city so we could say that there is a nice assortment. From my experience house prices for acceptable properties with average sizes (around 1500sqft home size on a 5000-7500sqft plot) would cost you $45k-$70k.</p>
<p>For big cities the situation is the same as for rentals, the prices could be similar to western mid-size places. Anyway assume a number north of the upper limits of the previous paragraph.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-994" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/house-970344_1920-1024x678.jpg" alt="House" width="640" height="424"></p>
<h3>Utilities</h3>
<p>In terms of utilities, I can only speak about my (and my peers) experiences. We used to live in a flat and our monthly bills added up to $110 per month on average. When we moved to our house our expenses rosed a bit thanks to heating bills. Electricity, water + sewer costs, waste removal, natural gas, landline + internet for our household averages around $200 per month. Your location does not really affect these numbers, the size of your home does.</p>
<h2>Transportation</h2>
<p>You should know two things about public transportation in Serbia. The first thing is that the tickets are not expensive. The second thing is that as a bonus you get an instant time travel 50 years back. While there are exceptions most vehicles are remainings of the last century and a lot of them are older than me.</p>
<h3>Railways</h3>
<p>My grandfather told me nice stories about the great Yugoslavian railways. <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/three-financial-lessons/">I wrote about him earlier</a> and told you that he was a &#8220;gastarbeiter&#8221; in Germany and he used the railways back then. The huge problem is that if you are not living in the middle of the country (around the capital city, Belgrade) if you see a newer train it is probably a foreign one. The rest of them are the same ones my grandpa used.</p>
<p>I had some friends who commuted to school by train. The rule was that if the train was not able to start in the morning the railway&nbsp;company provided an excuse to them for skipping the school that day. Once I was waiting for my train departure at 7&#8217;o clock in the morning. The first news was about a ten minute late. At 2 PM&nbsp;I gave up and went home. So, definitely not recommended for a daily commute.</p>
<p>Before I totally scare you away from using the railways in Serbia I have to tell that as a rule of thumb the longer the line of travel and the more international the line is the higher the probability is that the trip will actually happen. I used to travel a couple of times from the top of Serbia all the way down to the shores of the Adriatic sea in Montenegro for roughly 50 bucks. Also, if you want to experience the true essence of the Balkans I really recommend taking longer trips by train here. Expect something like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raby3rkC7Do">this video</a>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Bus companies</h3>
<p>As the glory of the railways was fading bus companies were breaking forth just to step on the same path. Again there are exceptions. As a rule of thumb the bigger the company is and have long and/or international lines the newer and better are the vehicles. The oldest ones are running between smaller towns and in public transport in small-medium sized cities. I remember a movie about the Montgomery bus boycott. Well, today I was traveling on a similar vehicle, maybe a little bit dirtier <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Again, prices are in correlation with the quality of the service. A local one-way bus ticket is $0.9, the monthly ticket is $25. Interurban lines are selling for roughly $0.15/mile. The exceptions are the international lines like the one to Austria. These are newer vehicles and a one-way ticket is $45. Tourist agencies have also good vehicles and fair prices, you can buy a return ticket to Chalkidiki, Greece for $70-80 per person.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-992" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bus-2423983_1920-695x1024.jpg" alt="Bus" width="640" height="943"></p>
<h3>Taxy &amp; Uber..ish companies</h3>
<p>Uber is non-existent over here but has some local flavors like&nbsp;<a href="http://appcargo.net/">CarGo</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.rs.blablacar.gg/">BlaBlaCar</a>. These are unfortunately usable only in bigger cities but you can find a taxi at pretty much every town. The prices are around $0.8 per km which I consider relatively cheap compared to western fares.</p>
<h3>Car ownership</h3>
<p>This is a topic worth a separate post alone so, for now, I would only tell that new car prices are relatively high, cars are not cheaper than in the western countries where salaries are multiples of ours. This sucks, I know but we are frugal folks after all so we buy only new to us cars, right?</p>
<p>Again a topic for a different day, but in terms of the used car market, you can buy a reliable smaller hatchback for $5-7k which can serve for a decade at least. Expect higher fuel prices than over the pond, still, if you travel in a group this could be a more economical option. If I don&#8217;t take the purchase price into account just the fuel and maintenance costs a family of four could probably travel by car for less (half-price to same cost range) than a bus ticket on a specific distance.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>And last but not least we reached the biggest positive factor in living here. As in a dominantly agricultural area, the local ingredients are relatively cheap and high in quality. Would not make a list myself here, but bumped into <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/food-prices/country_result.jsp?country=Serbia&amp;displayCurrency=USD">this great statistic site</a> lately. If you follow the link you can find a pretty accurate list from the basics and you can estimate your expenses based on your grocery buying habits. Let&#8217;s see some actual tips how should you get your food.</p>
<h3>Straight from the producer</h3>
<p>At almost every place there is someone who knows someone who produces this or that. While this is not an option for everyone if you can discover such a channel respect it as you probably found gold. This is the way to get the highest quality for the lowest price especially if you buy in bulk or if you become a loyal customer. If you are going through a village or small town and you see goods on a table or in buckets next to the road look for the owner, they will happy to serve you and even jump into juicy negotiations. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Farmers market</h3>
<p>The second best option and the best for the ones who like to do regular grocery shopping tours and get everything in one place. Vegetables, fruits, meat products and diaries are high in variability and the prices are good. The only important thing here is to always try to discover producers and try to avoid wholesalers to get the best quality for your money. Also, don&#8217;t really believe if you see an organic or bio label on anything. This trend is just conquering these parts and not totally respected by producers. I know about farmers who said when someone asked what is the difference between the bio and not bio versions that the non-bio producers are using chemicals by daylight&#8230;</p>
<h3>Supermarkets &amp; Hypermarkets</h3>
<p>These are offering pretty much everything exactly like anywhere else. The assortment is abundant, local stuff is dominant but you can find all the world-class brands and products. You should buy in bulk here everything you do not manage to get at the first two options.</p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-993" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/barbecue-1239145_1920-1024x778.jpg" alt="Meat" width="640" height="486"></h3>
<h3>Local food</h3>
<p>Ok, we reached even the most interesting part of this section. Similarly to cars this worth a separate post alone. If you are curious about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_cuisine">detailed list of the Serbian cuisine you can find it here</a>. Bakeries are the go to places in the morning to enjoy a full-filling burek (although not the healthiest choice) with jog(no h here)urt of course (for roughly $1.5-$2). Grill bars are literally everywhere, every little town has at least one of them. Unfortunately, they are renovating them to look more like fast food restaurants. Still, the end product is the same: tasty grilled meats and plenty of fresh veggies. You have to visit these places at lunch AND dinnertime ($2-$5/per meal). Yes, as you may be guessed your stomach <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/serbia/articles/11-traditional-serbian-dishes-you-need-to-try/">will be pampered here</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Oh, and at the end of the day you could still have only $10-$15 spent.</p>
<h3>Restaurants</h3>
<p>As a closing accord, I have to say that most of the restaurants over here are pretty good. They serve tasty meals for reasonable prices and most of the times the amounts are more than plenty. Of course in bigger cities, you could go for maximum fanciness at stellar prices but a reasonable small-middle sized city can offer you a very good quality and huge portions for around $5-$10 per meal. Even if I take into account the best restaurant in our town if you don&#8217;t pick something exotic (like sea-fish) you could fill your stomach for $8-$20. Add a glass of excellent local wine or artisan beer which would add another $3-$5 to the bill. Sounds tempting?</p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Living at our ends has its pros and cons just like any other place. This area is definitely not the best place for chasing FIRE. The only exception is if you can take advantage of geoarbitrage like hundreds of local companies and especially thousands of freelancers who provide high-quality professional services for the western world for western salaries. But as you were able to realize for now if you find the environment, the culture and the people over here a fit for your taste the countries of central-eastern Europe can be a tempting choice as a FIREplace. If nothing more, definitely worth an extended visit after you reached FIRE <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><em>What about you? Would you be able to retire to such a place? Do these numbers make these end tempting for FIREd folks? Share your ideas in the comments! See you soon.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/call-the-man-or-be-the-man/">revealed some details</a> about our current landscaping and &#8220;relawning&#8221; project. We made good progress so we thought we can have a day of rest and having fun. Some friends came over and we had a grill party. Recently, I acquired two bottles of homemade <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakia">Rakia</a>&nbsp;(a spirit, which is very popular in my country) so we went on with some tasting. Long story short, we had a good time, but unfortunately, I lost my sanity and the night closed with blackout&#8230; I am not proud of it and this is not something I am doing often.</p>
<p><iframe title="ALESTORM - Hangover (Taio Cruz Cover) | Napalm Records" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d5P5Tz3VH94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The next day I woke up with a horrible hangover. Was facing some hardships going through the daily routine, but we are responsible adults, after all, right? We have our duties which do not really care about our stupid decisions. So we have to suck it up and do whatever we have to do. Then when I was brainstorming for this post today after reading the latest post over at <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2018/04/10/hacking-hedonic-adaptation/">Mr.MoneyMustache.com</a> and was facing with this phrase I realized that the process to get over a financial hangover and a traditional one is pretty similar. Let&#8217;s see what are the steps.</p>
<h2>Facing the problem</h2>
<p>You are opening your eyes and realizing that you did something really stupid. You drank/spent more than you should have and despite the fact that at that moment it seemed a good idea now you can clearly feel that you made a huge mistake. You can feel the pain in your head and stomach/wallet or bank account. You know you are in trouble. Maybe your significant other is standing next to you reminding that she/he told you that it is not a good idea. You admit it that she/he is right, but still, that does not help on your condition. So, now that you realized what happened to you let&#8217;s get to the next step.</p>
<h2>Assess the damage</h2>
<p>Now you feel bad. The next thing is to start collecting information about the situation. You start off by examining the scene then questioning your fellow humans around you. Lastly, you turn to the internet. What did you mess up? How bad the situation really is? What would have been the right choice? Ok, this latter maybe does not help a lot but can bring you to the next step.</p>
<h2>Quick fix what you can</h2>
<p>In that case, if our previous investigation revealed some options that we can act on immediately we should go for it. Even if your stomach has a different opinion you should drink a couple of glasses of water alongside with a painkiller. Check your accounts and find out if you have any leftover money which you can throw into the face of the monster you unlocked. Do whatever it requires cleaning your head as much as possible.</p>
<h2>Create a plan</h2>
<p>When you are done applying the patches it is the time to step back and try to focus on the bigger picture. How will the recent events affect the near&nbsp;future? And what about the long-term? It is research time again. You&nbsp;have generated some problems, but that does not mean that you cannot ask for help. Just don&#8217;t be demanding or aggressive, you were the one who got yourself into trouble after all. Do your&nbsp;research and sketch up a plan for resolving the issues.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-825" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/light-1024x579.jpg" alt="Light" width="640" height="362"></p>
<h2>Suck it up and stick to it</h2>
<p>Now that we have a killer plan in hand (or maybe a dirty piece of paper with almost uninterpretable handwriting) we know what we can expect from the future. Maybe we are scared, disappointed or distressed. Maybe all of these and more. We have to face it: it will be tough. But the more you are thinking about it you start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Suddenly a scene pops into your mind. A woman is whispering in your ear.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>This&nbsp;will not&nbsp;be&nbsp;over quickly. You&nbsp;will not&nbsp;enjoy this.</em>&#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>You start smiling.</p>
<h2>Support the healing process</h2>
<p>With your plan in hand and confidence in your ability to fix the mistakes, the healing process can begin. The path will be rough. You will need your desperation and will, but you feel that you can manage it. There&#8217;s a chance sometime nausea will strike. Maybe even you can discover signs of depression. But remind yourself that these are just symptoms of a problem what is temporary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had different plans for today’s post, but then yesterday something happened. Liz from <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/">ChiefMomOfficer.com</a> shared <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/12/03/567602293/what-living-on-100-000-a-year-looks-like">this</a> article on <a href="https://twitter.com/LizOfficer/status/937334143284924416">twitter</a>. I stated there that I don’t want to be rude so I will not go on a rant. But the topic did not let me rest so I decided to do so but try to keep myself from being rude. I really like the <a href="https://www.1500days.com/tag/thursday-rant/">Thursday Rant series</a> by Mr.1500 and how he handles this kind of topics so gave it a shot.</p>
<p>My reactions went like this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-534" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/anger.gif" alt="Six Figure Problem Anger" width="500" height="278"></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-537" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/confused.gif" alt="Six Figure Problem Confusion" width="500" height="281"></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-536" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/math.gif" alt="Six Figure Problem Math" width="500" height="279"></p>
<p>At first, I felt angry, then realized that everybody has the right to live his/her life as he/she wants to. So, in the end, it left me with confusion, like &#8220;How come?&#8221; and started to think about the backgrounds.</p>
<h2>Investigating the math</h2>
<p>I started with some assumptions. First that these people are human beings just like me, thus they have the same basic needs. The rest is really just personal preference, so let&#8217;s go with the averages. Oh, and please don’t tell me that this struggle is caused by huge medical bills (or something similar). That can be the cause in some cases (which is totally understandable), but it seems a lot of six-figure earners have this problem and I bet most of them does not have this special circumstance.</p>
<p>I thought that this should be caused by the dark side of geoarbitrage. If living in the US is simply that much more expensive then riddle solved. At least I would have been able to think this if I was not following the FIRE community for a while. If Jacob from http://earlyretirementextreme.com/ is able to live on $14k, Mr.MoneyMustache on $25k and many other bloggers on $25k-$50k per year in the US then this cannot be the real cause. So I started to search for data. It turned out there is a cool website called <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/">Numbeo</a> which have living cost data from both Serbia and the US. You can check the data for <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=Serbia&amp;displayCurrency=USD">Serbia here</a> and for the <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=United+States">US here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Cost of living in&nbsp;<span class="purple_light">Serbia</span>&nbsp;is 48.42%<span class="green_light">&nbsp;lower</span>&nbsp;than in&nbsp;<span class="rose_light">United States</span>&nbsp;(aggregate data for all cities, rent is not taken into account). Rent in&nbsp;<span class="purple_light">Serbia</span>&nbsp;is 79.23%<span class="green_light">&nbsp;lower</span>&nbsp;than in&nbsp;<span class="rose_light">United States</span>&nbsp;(average data for all cities).</p></blockquote>
<p>If you compare the two tables you can see that depending on the type of expense the multipliers vary heavily. Housing is the biggest difference I think, it is much cheaper here (that&#8217;s why real estate investment is not so tempting). On the other hand, there are some equalities like basic utilities and clothing. Most of the things fell in the 2x-4x cheaper range and there are even things which are more expensive than in the states. Gasoline, electronics, and cars fell definitely into this category.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;I do a rough summary and estimation my guess is that the living costs for my American&nbsp;doppelganger should be no more than 2-3 times more than my expenses. In terms of annual expenses, <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/money-map-of-a-non-budgeter/">I am similar</a> to Jacob, it is around $14k per year for our family of four (but note that I have an&nbsp;above the average salary). Saying this that should fall in the range of $30k-$45k. Which is very far from that magical six-figure barrier. According to the expense reports from other bloggers, this number is kind of realistic.</p>
<p>Then if you check the whole bunch of data you can come to the last lines. If you look close enough you can see that the average US after-taxes income is roughly 8 times higher. You wonder how can people live on $400 a month? Well, to be honest, I am curious about that too, but I know that it has to be possible because a lot of people participating in that quest around here. And despite a lot of people leaves the country these days there are still millions living there an average life. Yes, even with American standards.</p>
<p>I can go on for ages with the comparison, but who can see the numbers and get what I want to say I think this is enough.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>So back to these poor fellows who struggling to live on a six-figure income. After looking into the numbers I had to come to the same conclusion as my initial thought was.&nbsp;These people have serious problems and it is not that 100k is not enough&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aside from some prolonged <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/funny-friday-black-friday-edition/">Black Friday</a> / Cyber Monday offers we can say that the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/random-thoughts-on-thanksgiving-and-black-friday/">shopping craze</a> is over. Or at least it has a halt until the final rush of massive Christmas shopping begins. Everybody knows his preferences, for me, it is to keep away from the whole madness as much as I can. But as you know that cannot be the case all the times, there are some occasions when you have to buy or replace everyday objects of use and these times you can face a plethora of offers.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are real deals around there when you can the coveted value for a smaller price. Also, there are deals when you get better value for the same amount of money. Do you feel the difference? While both scenarios are legit it really depends on your needs and the type of the goods you want to buy. Note that I am talking strictly about planned purchases here, not the instant gratification style.</p>
<p>There are situations when you have to buy something instantly, but it is a good idea to delay a purchase if you can and wait for better offers. Almost every type of product has a sales season, summer clothes in autumn, winter clothes in the spring, phones, and cars before the release of the next generation, holiday shopping sprees, etc. But please don’t let the upcoming offers guide your plans, know what you want and know the price you want to pay for it.</p>
<p>But how should you evaluate what type of product do you need or what range should you look around? If you want a laptop, should you buy a cheap Chromebook for a couple hundred or a high end MacBook for a couple of thousand dollars? If you want a new cellphone should you buy a new Nokia 3310 for $49 or a brand new iPhone X for $1149? As I said it really depends on individual needs, but over time I developed a ruleset which proved to be a good guideline for me. It probably will not fit your needs and will not include the stuff you are after, but if you get the logic behind it you will be able to create your own ruleset.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-507 size-large" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/my_stuff_evaluation_ruleset_phone-1024x735.png" alt="My Stuff Evaluation Ruleset" width="640" height="459"></p>
<h2>My Stuff Evaluation Ruleset</h2>
<blockquote><p>Don’t buy a phone for the price of a tablet.<br />
Don’t buy a tablet for the price of a PC.<br />
Don’t buy a PC for the price of a laptop.<br />
Don’t buy a laptop for the price of a car.<br />
Don’t buy a car for the price of a house.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I feel the anger of gadget geeks, apple fanboys and haters who don’t understand how can cars and especially homes appear on this list at all. Give me a minute to go over the rules one by one and explain my points. And even before that please note that this is strictly the personal use scenario, professional needs (working machine, business phone) are above these rules. Also, I will not answer the eternal debates about Windows/MacOS and Android/iOS. I have my own preferences, but definitely there isn’t one right answer, besides “it depends”.</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t buy a phone for the price of a tablet.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a no brainer for me because of two reasons. First, I am clumsy with phones, so causing damage to them or losing them at all is very high possibility which makes buying an expensive phone a very idea. Secondly, I use a phone for what it is intended, making phone calls and sometimes send text messages. Every other operation which should be done on a 2&#8243;-4&#8243; screen drives me mad and my typing speed is nowhere compared to the keyboard. I am &#8220;fortunate&#8221; enough to spend a lot of time in front of big screens where I am much more productive than a phone.</p>
<p>My range for buying a reasonable phone is $50-$250.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Don’t buy a tablet for the price of a PC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My motto is that there is no (online) life under 10&#8243; and this is where tablet usage starts.&nbsp;As you can guess now, the target value category here for every article is the golden middle range, when you pay a little bit more for not struggling with the defects of cheapness, but also will not pay for the overhyped name of a brand. Anyway, a tablet is (should be) a much more powerful and usable tool than a phone so it is realistic to accept a higher price range. Same time a middle category desktop PC should be a more useful thing than a tablet which creates another barrier.</p>
<p>My range for buying a reasonable tablet is $250-$500.</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t buy a PC for the price of a laptop.</p></blockquote>
<p>Following the same analogy desktop PC-s and laptops, aren&#8217;t created equal. Also there are a bunch of factors which define what type of performance do you really need, but the assumption here is that you need a specific performance which should be cheaper in case of a desktop PC and more expensive in case of a laptop, however this point starts to get a little bit outdated as technology evolves.</p>
<p>My range for buying a reasonable PC is $500-$750.</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t buy a laptop for the price of a car.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this is the most sensitive spot for many debaters, because how dare I even mentioning this two things in the same range. Well, my logic here is very simple. The machine my employer provides me at work costs $3000+, so I have my daily apple… I know it is for work, but same time there are a huge amount of people who choose a similar machine just for everyday use. This year we bought a “new” (for us) car in very good condition for the slightly higher price of $4500. I know that the two things have a very different application, it is an apple to oranges comparison but still, a car is a more valuable thing in my opinion than a laptop.</p>
<p>My range for buying a reasonable laptop is $750-$1.000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-510 size-large" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/my_stuff_evaluation_ruleset_house-1024x752.png" alt="My Stuff Evaluation Ruleset House" width="640" height="470"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t buy a car for the price of a house.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, this is probably the most weird of all the statements, at least if we look at real estate prices with a western standard. But I have to tell, that buying a smaller family home for $35k or a fixer-upper for $25k is not an unrealistic thing, while for $60k you can buy a very good property. Around $100k at our ends you can buy a fancy lakeside villa or half of a village. This is definitely not a used car price range, but I bet that you know someone too who is riding around on the roads with a house priced beast car.</p>
<p>My range for buying a reasonable used car is $1.500-$8.000.</p>
<p>My range for buying a reasonable new car is $12.500-$25.000.</p>
<p>My range for buying a reasonable house is $25.000-$100.000.</p>
<p><em>So, you have it, this is my list of rules for evaluation of &#8220;stuff&#8221; prices. This list is far comprehensive and definitely not for all. It is tailored based my needs, wants and values. What about you? Do you agree with my rules? Can you relate some of them? What would you define differently? Please share with me in the comments.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week the long-awaited or long-hated (depends on your perspective) Thanksgiving and Black Friday will come. As I reported <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/funny-friday-black-friday-edition/">last week</a> it’s over at our ends, they held it last weekend for some reason. This is not an event which I fanatically wait all year long, just another sales date when I check if only there is something on sale which I had plans on buying for a while. I did not want to waste any more words on the topic, but meanwhile, some thoughts formulated in my mind which I wanted to share.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-482 size-full" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Thanksgiving-Turkey-Meme-1.jpg" alt="Thanksgiving Turkey" width="620" height="431"></p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t ruin Thanksgiving</h2>
<p>J$ at BudgetsAreSexy wrote an interesting article with the title&nbsp;<a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/are-you-financially-average/">Are You Financially Average?</a>. At the end there is an interesting statistic about some people&#8217;s plans.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>22% of Americans plan to begin their Black Friday shopping online after Thanksgiving dinner</li>
<li>11% of Americans admit to shopping on their mobile phones during Thanksgiving dinner</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While I consider the first fact slightly acceptable, the second one totally makes me crazy. Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you humans?&nbsp;In an optimal situation there is delicious food and good company gathered together to express their gratitude. Enjoy it when you can, damn it. It is not the proper time for hunting bargains under the table.</p>
<p>A couple of times I had encounters with mobile tappers at the table on family gatherings and it turned out pretty quickly, that I have a serious allergy from that phenomenon. My blood pressure rises and I feel an instant urge to throw their phones out of the window. Unfortunately, I cannot do this with other people’s kids and mobiles not bought by me, but I always pledge that I will do so if my children will behave like that.</p>
<p><em>Note for future me: buy only cheap phones for the kids!</em></p>
<h2>Don’t risk your life</h2>
<p>It is unbelievable to me that every year humans die/get injured because of shopping. I can imagine a thousand scenarios when risking your life would be an option but grabbing a toaster for 99% less than it’s normal price is not on the list (not even close). According to the news (I don’t have any personal experience so I have to relate them), in some cases, they even use physical power or pepper spray against each other. Again, what the fuck is wrong with you? So please, if getting a new (insert any product here) is not a life-or-death situation please stay at home and do something more fulfilling. If the urge is serious, attack online shops instead.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-485" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thanksgiving_black_friday_not_sure.jpg" alt="Not sure if Black Friday or Hunger Games" width="552" height="414"></p>
<h2>Don’t buy just anything</h2>
<p>I assume you are all rational, intentional, frugal human beings out there, thus I am preaching to the choir, but still I have to emphasize this. The fact that you can buy something for the fraction of its real price does not mean that you need it. Everybody likes (loves?) saving money and getting great deals. But that is a deal/saving only if you need that thing. Otherwise it’s just wasting your time and money.</p>
<p><em>My two tips on this topic:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>buy only products on sale which you would buy for the original price too</em></li>
<li><em>make a list of items you really need (use watchlists or whatever) and only check those</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These were just my two cents. Happy celebrations for everyone. And please take care!</p>
