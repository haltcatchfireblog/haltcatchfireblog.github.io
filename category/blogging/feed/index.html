										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy fellas!</p>
<p>Long time no see.</p>
<p>As anyone can tell, this second half of the year <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wake-me-up-when-september-ends/">wasn&#8217;t my most productive</a> period in terms of blogging and otherwise. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am not apologizing and have no regrets. Many times I exchanged &#8220;blogging time&#8221; for simply hanging out with my wife or playing late with my daughters. Life is about priorities and we all have the same scarce resource of time which we decide where to invest. After all, I am just one of the <a href="https://indeedably.com/fire-extinguisher">grey pigeons</a> of financial blogging, writing gibberish to random strangers on the interwebz. In some cases, a discussion arises and we get to know each other even more. Sometimes we even get friends. And when this happens it is wonderful.</p>
<p>These days there is a lot of criticism about (financial) bloggers in general and especially about this phenomenon I like to protect, the FIRE movement. Some arguments are legit and some are invalid. I have my opinions but who am I to judge? Perception is a wonderful thing after all <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> All I can do is that I try to be honest with myself and others and stay on the <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/2018/12/14/the-financial-content-creator-ethics-pledge/">righteous&nbsp;side</a>. While I left the consistent publishing schedule far behind (if I ever followed it&#8230;) making all the SEO and blogging gods fretful and probably acquired some bonus points on the &#8220;worlds worst blogger&#8221; contest, I really wanted to publish something meaningful as the closing post of this year.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1243" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1243" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1243 size-large" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/gandalf-1024x576.jpg" alt="Gandalf" width="640" height="360"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1243" class="wp-caption-text">Wisdom is always welcome from trustable sources</figcaption></figure>
<p>Don&#8217;t run away I will not pull out my red pencils and count the achieved and failed blogging goals for the year. Neither will I introduce you to the secret five-point&nbsp;list which will bring you the ultimate new-year-resolution-maker-goal-setting-process. In a <a href="https://indeedably.com/fire-extinguisher/#comment-337">recent&nbsp;discussion</a>, I stated that &#8220;the best things what you can earn in this community is friendship and knowledge I think&#8221;. Then somehow the long discontinued <a href="https://www.1500days.com/category/gratitude/">Gratitude series on 1500days.com</a>&nbsp;popped into my mind and I&nbsp;thought that I will combine these two thoughts and wrap up the year with a gratitude post.</p>
<p>I believe in the power of words and I love when I get introduced to new (or at least new to me) words or expressions. For one of these words, I am grateful to a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/the-falcon-method">fellow Hungarian investor, David</a>. I learned a lot of other things but one of my favorite expressions also came from him. It is &#8220;selective contrarian&#8221;. It is widely used in investment terms but I think you can also use it for your overall outlook on the world. When I spend my time as not a creator but a consumer of content (most of the time) I always searching for such unique voices in the big mass of ideas, teachings, and preachings. Every now and then I find one.&nbsp;And when this happens it is wonderful.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to say goodbye to this blogging year by expressing my gratitude to all the folks who are kind to my heart and enriched my life on a way. Their contributions are sometimes ideas I found interesting, entertaining or educating. These brought me smiles, improved my thinking or even drove my financial decisions. And in some rare cases, the ideas brought me epiphanies or left me seriously thinking about my life and my future. While the former is&nbsp;important too&nbsp;the revelations brought by the latter are game changers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1241" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/real_mvp.jpg" alt="you da real mvp" width="250" height="250"></p>
<p>Without any further ado let me introduce you to the voices and ideas which contributed most to my mindset this year. The list is probably not complete and there is no importancy, alphabetical or other ranking, just the order they pop into my mind.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com">J$</a></h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs kick off the list with a true rockstar. To be honest I never expected that when you ping a top blogger he will actually answer. But Jay did. Every. Single. Time. With a joking tone one-liner or a longer description if I asked something. And sometimes with a much-needed encouragement.</p>
<p>In terms of wisdom, I can point my finger on two things.</p>
<p>One is that sometimes you have to ‚ÄúLet It Go‚Äù. Even if that is a big project which was built by yourself from scratch. It does not matter how much you want to keep it if it keeps you away from things which are most important to you it is time to say farewell.</p>
<p>The other thing is his weirdo <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/why-im-obsessed-with-cemeteries/">obsession with cemeteries</a>. While I don‚Äôt totally share this emotion I can relate to the feeling and nothing puts your life more into perspective than facing your mortality and remembering that <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/deadly-finance/">sooner or later the road will come to an end</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.1500days.com">Mr.1500</a></h3>
<p>Carl is another awesome guy, whom I also thought is out of my reach but interestingly he replied to my emails every now and then. I cannot really point on a single idea of his but his story as it flows gives me inspiration. And peace. There are dozens of posts out there about the fear of retiring because folks just don‚Äôt know what to do with their life. Carl‚Äôs post-retirement life is the living example that I should not worry. He kept coding, he improved his health and did all kind of fun and <a href="https://www.1500days.com/i-left-my-job-one-year-ago-heres-how-its-going/">cool stuff with his family</a>. Let‚Äôs talk about mapping fulfilling future&#8230;</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.keepthrifty.com">Chris Durheim</a></h3>
<p>Chris is also a programmer and a fellow father with daughters. You see a pattern here? Yeah, I like to search for like-minded folks, let‚Äôs go on. So, Chris took a one-year mini-retirement and then extended it. Most of the times you read only the good about such stories. But where is the bad and the ugly? Well, Chris had to realize that it is not always <a href="https://www.keepthrifty.com/mini-retirement-mental-breakdown/">rainbows and unicorns</a>. But still, the take-home message is that if you go beyond your comfort zone you can find personal growth even if you <a href="https://www.keepthrifty.com/financial-failure-personal-success/">fail on a way or succeed on another</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://othalafehu.com">OthalaFehu</a></h3>
<p>If you would ask me to point my finger on a true badass in the community I would pick him. His posts are not long winded so I will try to wrap up his wisdom the same way:</p>
<p><a href="https://othalafehu.com/tales-crimeside/">Change is possible</a>,<br />
<a href="https://othalafehu.com/personal-story/">Discipline is important</a>,<br />
<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/prepping-for-non-preppers-101/">Preparedness is golden</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org">ChiefMomOfficer</a></h3>
<p>Liz is an incredible person, a true energy bomb. Sometimes I start being suspicious if she had a secret interview with Hermione Granger for her <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/women-on-fire/">Woman On Fire</a> series but she never published it to keep the fact in secret that she passed on that <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Time-Turner">time turner</a> to her so she can have more than 24 hours a day. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> She published dozens of educative posts but the one which is closest to my heart tells the <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/2017/03/06/going-into-crisis-mode-when-it-all-goes-to-hell-a-story-of/">story of their fight with death</a>. Yeah, sometimes it is sobering to remember that bad things can happen with good people so having an emergency fund and a plan B at hand is always a good idea.</p>
<h3><a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Groovy</a></h3>
<p>As I told you I like learning new expressions and the <a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/am-i-about-to-become-a-teat-sucking-layabout/">‚Äúteat sucking layabout‚Äù</a> could be the expression of the year. But there is more wisdom here than a geniusly fabricated expression. The biggest lesson for me in their story is that you can be different. You can take <a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/the-broken-windows-of-personal-finance/">ownership of your stuff</a> and you can change things if you really want. Mr. Groovy worked a government job for a long time, despite we share a similar disgust about how they are running their(?) business. He was able to make a difference just by changing his mindset, taking over control and improve himself. As a result, they enjoy post-retirement life in a location of their choice in a home they built recently. &#8220;<a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/not-lazy-slob/">Don‚Äôt embrace the sloth</a>&#8221; is huge take-home message here.</p>
<h3><a href="https://mysterymoneyman.com">MisteryMoneyMan</a></h3>
<p>MisteryMoneyMan is the other MMM whose posts I like to read. I am also a follower of his insider email series where he shares his adventures as a hustler. While I am collecting the ideas from his reportings the reason why I added him to the list is an act which is not so common, even in the FIRE community. Recently, instead of rushing on the good old corporate ladder he just <a href="https://mysterymoneyman.com/why-im-climbing-down-the-corporate-ladder/">simply climbed down a little</a> to regain some of his time and freedom. I am not working in such a hierarchy where this would be something I could do, but the idea of giving up a bigger opportunity for the greater good is something I want to keep in mind just in case a situation will ever arise. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/">AbandonedCubicle</a></h3>
<p>Cubert is a true joker, I always like to read his writings but despite he is playing with FIRE recently the area he widened my view is real estate. He owns some <a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/category/build-wealth-with-rental-properties/">rental properties</a> which he renovated mostly by himself and running an <a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/airbnb-experiment/">experiment with Airbnb</a>. These are topics which are picking my mind because of future investment possibilities so it is good to have insights on how others solve issues and share their raw numbers.</p>
<h3><a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/">CheesyFinance</a></h3>
<p>Mr. CF is a cheerful guy and I really like his original ideas and thought experiments. The ‚Äú<a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/category/should-you/">should you buy a‚Ä¶</a>‚Äù series brought his name to this list. The idea of actually <a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/2018/08/06/should-you-buy-a-yacht/">buying a boat</a> never crossed my mind (there aren‚Äôt many wooden pirate ships out there for a reasonable price) but I have to admit that <a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/2018/08/27/should-you-buy-a-castle/">buying (or building) a castle</a> did and his numbers in this post confirm that it is not absolute insanity (like my wife thinks). An <a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/2018/09/06/should-you-buy-an-island/">island would be</a> an equally awesome thing but the financial rationality wasn‚Äôt really backed by the numbers. We have some more work to do here <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/">WhatLifeCouldBe</a></h3>
<p>Mr. &amp; Mrs. White (and their kids) are charming people. The types you sit down with for the first time and five minutes later you are having a conversation like if you know each other for ages. After I discovered the European FIRE scene through <a href="https://firehub.eu/">FIREHub.eu</a> and read about <a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2015/10/07/about-us/">their life</a> on their blog they were the first people I was speaking with in real life via Skype. When it turned out that I cannot attend the <a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/tag/fiwe/">FIWE</a>, their annual conference we agreed that we will meet sometime in person as we are living only one border away. This happened this summer and we spent a wonderful day chatting, biking, walking around, having a nice lunch and some drinks. The kids also had a great time and I am looking forward to repeating the occasion sometime next year.</p>
<p>Besides this great experience, I wanted to emphasize Mr. Ws&#8217; incredible mindset about handling obstacles. He <a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2018/09/25/i-want-to-change-the-world/">believes in making a difference</a> and that it can be started on a small scale, locally. I am always impressed when I read about <a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2018/11/21/talking-personal-finance-poor-mums/">such endeavors</a> of his. He is the living example for the saying ‚Äúwhen there‚Äôs a will there‚Äôs a way‚Äù. We should all learn that letting our priorities drive our lives and fighting passivity are some of the best places we could invest our times.</p>
<h3><a href="https://retireinprogress.com/">RetireInProgress</a></h3>
<p>I discovered Mr. RIPs&#8217; blog earlier this year and at first, I have only read some of the latest posts. His writing style and humor caught me and I started to dig deeper. That&#8217;s how I found out about <a href="http://retireinprogress.com/category/mystory/">his origin story</a> and it blew my mind. A life packed with challenges, struggles, victories, dreams achieved and left behind. The very important lesson is that even reaching to the top, getting many coders <a href="http://retireinprogress.com/mystory7/">dream job</a> does not automatically skyrockets you to lalaland and when the magic starts to vanish you realize the golden handcuffs on your wrist. His approach to dream, work for it, test and dump it if you don‚Äôt enjoy it anymore is something more of us should adopt.</p>
<h3><a href="https://indeedably.com">{in¬∑deed¬∑a¬∑bly}</a></h3>
<p>The biggest lesson here: don&#8217;t use Google when someone <a href="https://indeedably.com/normalcy/">told you so</a>‚Ä¶ Jokes apart, {in¬∑deed¬∑a¬∑bly} is a late discovery but instantly jumped to the top of my favorite list. He is one of the few bloggers who excels in storytelling and using it to make his posts more colorful. It is not just the appealing design of his blog but a very unique perspective is what sucked me into binge reading his posts. Hard to pick a single best one, I haven‚Äôt found any which isn‚Äôt inspiring, educating, entertaining or the combination of these. Maybe the most thought-provoking is which provides the framework for <a href="https://indeedably.com/financial-planning/">financial planning</a> and the funniest is the story about the <a href="https://indeedably.com/subversion/">creativity of his kids</a>. Looking forward to consuming more delicious thought food of his in the future.</p>
<h3><a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/">EarlyRetirementDude</a></h3>
<p>I had a professor back at the university teaching us Calculus I. He was a mean guy with an individual sense of humor. He was trolling us all the time and joking on our unpreparedness. I became a drop-out for the first time because of his class. But I started over and tried again. I passed his exam for the 10th time with a lot of effort and help from others. Then next year came Calculus II and he became not just the professor but the lecturer also. After a couple of lessons, I realized that I was totally wrong about him in the previous years. He wasn‚Äôt the douchebag we thought he is but we were the idiots who did not take life seriously enough. He just had a particular way of mocking us and trying to make us face with the harsh truth that we should stop whining and start working harder if we want to achieve our goals. Looking back now he may have been one of the best teachers I ever had.</p>
<p>The reason I started this introduction with this flashback is that after I started reading ER Dudes‚Äô posts I felt the same. At first, I thought that this is an extremely smart grumpy guy who spreads his wisdom with a pinch of sarcasm all the time. Then I realized that he is just an extremely smart and extremely honest guy who shoots his wisdom towards you without a single sprinkle of bullshit. He taught me many valuable lessons about the <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/the-history-of-fier/">origins of the FI/ER movement</a> or the true <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/summary-tuesdays-reddit-interview-inventor-4-rule/">nature of the 4% rule</a>. Still, there was <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/early-retirement-expectations-unrealistic-probably-wrong/">one thought</a> which made a huge impact on my thinking and made me look at my job through a completely different set of lenses. Please read the quote and there will be no need for further explanation.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúYour job‚Äôs a business transaction. You may want to sell your time to these people and they may want to buy it from you‚Ä¶so when you feel desperate for the door &#8211; really desperate &#8211; remember: if you want your freedom that badly, the door‚Äôs right there. Nobody‚Äôs hiding the keys. All else is a matter of compromise.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>The interesting thing is that this single quote freed me up from worry. It gave a joker card in my hand. Maybe you would expect that as a result, I turned in my notice. Actually, what happened is quite the opposite. I enjoy my job more than ever. I took ownership of my stuff and I am not just drifting anymore but dictating the direction and don‚Äôt shy away anymore from saying out loud what I am thinking. When you realize that the door is actually there, you can leave whenever you want, nobody‚Äôs hiding the keys and nobody‚Äôs holding you back you will experience freedom. It is like having the FU money‚Ä¶ except I don‚Äôt have that FU money but I know that I could find another job or I could indulge in entrepreneurship and still would be able to provide to my family. In a way I guess, this is similar to the freedom of after FIRE life.</p>
<h3><a href="https://financial-independence.eu/">Financial Independence Europe podcast</a></h3>
<p>Last but not least I wanted to add the one and only podcast to the list which I was able to stick with. I have to admit that I am not a podcast listener. I rarely do activities which makes a great fit with podcast listening. Tried to follow some in the past but until now there wasn&#8217;t a single one which was able to get me listening episode after episode. I cannot really emphasize a single piece of wisdom as all the episodes are interesting on a way. So, thank you <a href="https://financiallymint.com/">Araminta</a>, Matthias, and Alvar for treating us with many fresh ideas and perspectives. I see a big potential in reaching your goals with the podcast.</p>

<p><em>It is almost sure that I have left out someone or something. When it will hit me I will come back and update this post, but for now, my dear reader, this is it. Hope you found something which is interesting, entertaining or educating for you too. And if you are anything like me, maybe you had some epiphanies too.</em></p>
<p><em>With this, I want to thank you all for reading my silly think soups this year. Wishing you all a very Happy New Year and I hope the discoveries, on both side, will continue next year.</em></p>
<p><em>Take care!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>‚ÄúHey, look at him, he is alive, the guy who stated that he will get back on track with posting then disappeared.‚Äù</p>
<p>I know, I know and you are right. I should have been waking up <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wake-me-up-when-september-ends/">when September ends</a>. And now it is almost the end of October and all I published is a rant about <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/thanks-for-your-concern-suze-but-the-fire-movement-is-fine/">the Suze Orman phenomenon</a>. She <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/suze-orman-big-pivots-bad-publicity-always-seem-icky-said/">apparently ‚Äúchanged‚Äù her mind</a>, btw.</p>
<p>So what happened? Well, I try to stick with a new writing schedule and carve out 1-2 hours at least 2-3 evenings a week. Same time it seems I got more critical towards my writings, I accumulated four drafts so far but was not satisfied&nbsp;with (or did not finish) them. That&#8217;s why you have seen no posts. I felt that it would be better if I could publish one good article in a month than one crappier every week.</p>
<p>But don‚Äôt afraid, I was actually working on something in the last two weeks. Just not for my own blog. Carl, alias <a href="https://www.1500days.com/start-here/">Mr. 1500</a>, reloaded his <a href="https://www.1500days.com/10-questions/">10 questions series</a> a few months ago and kindly invited us, blogging noobies to participate. I jumped on the opportunity and did not want to phone it. I think I ended up with more than 20 answers and 3k words. I was tempted to answer them all but many of these would have been non-interesting one-liners so just skipped including those. Just in case you are curious about what would be my answer to any of them let me know in the comments section and I will fill the void.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/coders-of-finance/">Coders Of Finance</a> series I am the one who <del datetime="2018-07-20T09:20:58+02:00">knocks</del> asks questions, but interestingly there are occasions when others are curious about my answers to some of their questions. At first, these came only in form of spam comments and emails asking if I am interested in some Ponzi schemes, free viagra samples or services I definitely don‚Äôt need.<br />
Then my first legit indulgement into the interviewing world happened by taking the BoaS Question Series over at¬†<a href="https://www.budgetonastick.com/hcf/">BudgetOnAStick.com</a> (beware, memes involved).</p>
<p>And now I am happy to announce that I took my second virtual interview, the Random Question Series over at my good ol‚Äô friends awesome blog <a href="https://www.mysonsfather.com/">MySonsFather.com</a>.</p>
<p>He claims himself the worlds worst blogger (WWB), but this competition is not closed yet and I have good chances to beat him. I mean, he creates <a href="https://www.mysonsfather.com/mr-1500-visits-the-fi-laboratory/">awesome LEGO stories</a> like this one about famous bloggers like Mr. 1500, had <a href="https://www.mysonsfather.com/random-questions-mr-1500/">Mr. 1500 participating</a> as the first guest in his Random Questions series, also he will soon meet with Mr. 1500 in person‚Ä¶ (Do you see a pattern here?)</p>
<p>Also, he and his lovely wife appeared in a recent <a href="http://countdowntofi.com/episode-30-a-fi-4-way/">CountdownToFI podcast episode</a> alongside with the <a href="http://countdowntofi.com/">CTFs</a> (sorry guys, but this always echoes in my head as Capture The Flag, damn, the 90‚Äôs ruined me), the <a href="http://wafflesonwednesday.com/">WoWs</a>, and the <a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/">Groovies</a>. See, this is a helluva fancy lineup.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-1002 aligncenter" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/spidey.jpg" alt="spidey" width="469" height="359" /><br />
So, as you can see, my dear reader, he has no right to claim the WWB title for himself, I am definitely better at being bad than him. And to prove it I will finish this post now, under YoastSEOs recommended word count and with no summary or parting words. Take this MSF! I am in the finish line <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To be totally honest I wasn&#8217;t sure if this day will come. But it did, so I can peacefully write it down:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am six months into blogging.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe it seems like not a big deal to you, but it is huge for me. I am a recovering procrastinator and a serial quitter. Back in last September when I published <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/escaping-the-matrix/">my first post</a>&nbsp;with trembling hands I was a total noob. Wrote a mini CMS before, just for fun (and for some side money) but never spent more than 5 minutes in WordPress. Never used social media accounts. And last but not least I have never published anything online, especially not in English.</p>
<p>Now, six months later, I am confident with using WordPress, configuring plugins, messing around with domain names, hosting settings and even with <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/memes-reloaded/">the source code</a>. As an IT guy, this shouldn&#8217;t be a big surprise, actually, it would be a shame if I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>What is even a bigger achievement for me, is that I get along with Twitter, my first and only social media account. Maybe I dare say I like it. The rest of the social media platforms are still &#8220;terra incognita&#8221; for me and I am ok with this situation for now.</p>
<p>Still, the biggest win for me is that I managed to write some articles which entertained, educated or forced people to think about the topic. And most importantly in a way that they understood what I wanted to say. For a not native speaker, like me, this was a big challenge and a great exercise. (Fun fact: wrote roughly 30k words)</p>
<p>When I see this kind of reports from other bloggers they always publish some numbers. I did too when I was three months into this gig and <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/">struggled with doubts</a>. So let&#8217;s see the progress. Also, summarize the wins and fails.</p>
<h2>Numbers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Published posts: 37 (14 of them in the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/funny-friday/">Funny Friday series</a>, 5 of them in the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/memes/">Memes</a>&nbsp;section)</li>
<li>All time views: 3785 (by 2416 visitors)</li>
<li>Email subscribers: 3 (+1 in the last three months, woot-woot)</li>
<li>Followers: 7(+2) via WordPress, 286(+94) via Twitter</li>
<li>Most popular post:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/pirates-of-the-cryptobbean/">Pirates of the Cryptobbean</a></li>
<li>Best views ever: March 6th, 877 views from 720 visitors on a single day</li>
<li>Best referrers: <a href="http://rockstarfinance.com/">RockstarFinance</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://thefinancialdiet.com/">TheFinancialDiet</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep blogging for at least a year &#8211; six months check, so good so far</li>
<li>Established and consolidated connections and friendships in the community</li>
<li>Started an interview series (<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/coders-of-finance/">Coders of Finance</a>)</li>
<li>My first crypto post, <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/pirates-of-the-cryptobbean/">Pirates of the Cryptobbean</a>&nbsp;got selected and featured on <a href="https://rockstarfinance.com/pirates-of-the-cryptobbean/">RockStarFinance</a>&nbsp;(a big THANKS to <a href="http://lifezemplified.com/">Amy</a> and <a href="https://esimoney.com">ESI</a>) &#8211; This was the biggest win of this six months, one which I didn&#8217;t dare dream about!</li>
<li>When I mentioned one of my articles(my personal favorite, <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/memento-mori/">Memento Mori</a>) in a comment to <a href="http://jmoney.biz/">J$</a>(one of my blogger role models) over at <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/why-im-obsessed-with-cemeteries/">BudgetsAreSexy</a>&nbsp;he was able to recall it and quote the last sentences. It was a proud moment <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-707" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/crypto_skull.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401"></p>
<h2>Fails</h2>
<p>The only thing I regret is that I did not create enough new content. I had some personal barriers, but still, this is not a good excuse. The struggle of finding the time to write is still there, but I have to be honest with myself, I was not able to sacrifice family time for blogging. Not sure where that leaves me, but while blogging is a helluva fun cannot beat playing with my kids, reading bedtime stories and watching them fall asleep. I would sacrifice becoming the most successful blogger at any given time for being just a moderately awesome dad.</p>
<h2>Plans</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creating more useful content and publishing more articles is a huge goal for me, but I can promise that I will not hit the publish button just to publish something. Not a single time. That is over.</li>
<li>Continue searching for my voice/tribe/niche and as part of this, I want the blog to get more techie. I have plans on writing a few blogging tutorials about my experiences and going on with the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/coders-of-finance/">Coders of Finance</a> interview series and publish one every second week.</li>
<li>Start making memes again, there was a hiatus lately.</li>
<li>Keep it simple, keep it real <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s it for today, let&#8217;s review the things above in three months.</p>
<p>Thank you all for the encouragement and the kind words! You are awesome!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all, I want to wish a success packed very Happy New Year. I wasn&#8217;t too active in the recent holiday season and spent the last month getting back on track. As I stated in earlier I want to turn 2018 into a more techie year, thus I spent the last couple of days with geeking around with WordPress. The goal was to give memes a new way of appearance as I sent the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/funny-friday/">Funny Friday</a> series into early retirement.</p>
<p>I have to confess something. Before I started my blog and started using WordPress I was a hater. Back in the days when I entered web development, I was taught that it is evil. It is just a big pile of crappy spaghetti code and if you use it bad boys will hack your site and steal your data (maybe even your soul). I was a newbie and they were the seniors, so I accepted what they said and went on hating WordPress without any further investigation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-671" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/i_hated_wordpress.jpg" alt="I hated WordPress" width="460" height="480"></p>
<p>It is true that in those times these statements were partly valid. Those early versions were not so sophisticated and there were much more poorly coded third-party plugins and themes. These caused serious security problems in some cases. Still, I regret that I did not start&nbsp;examining the codebase and experimenting with template and plugin development earlier. I could be a WP Wizard these days.</p>
<p>Years went by. When I started to learn about blogging and realized that almost 30% (crazy!) percent of the&nbsp;websites on the internet is running on this platform this regret became even worse. Since I started this blog, I really wanted to dig a little bit into the topic and get my hands dirty. Unfortunately, while I was chasing my own deadlines I was not able to do so. Finally, the rethinking of the Funny Friday meme series brought the need for opening the hood and add tiny bits of code. As it turned out WP has a very handy develop documentation.</p>
<p>If you are not interested in a little bit of coding and you are satisfied with the functionality the codebase and the UI can provide, please, don&#8217;t read further. Just be delighted that the brand new MEMES sections became accessible from the top menu. Every time the muse visits me and I make a meme I will post it there. There will be new ones every sometimes <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h1>The tweak</h1>
<p>You may ask why did I have to tweak my WP setup to make this possible. Well, maybe it is just my personal preference, but I wanted the memes listing page to work a little bit differently. First of all, created a separate category called &#8220;Memes&#8221;, created a separate menu item for its listing page and added the first post,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/dont-save-like-dory/">Dory</a>&nbsp;as my guinea pig (ok, maybe this is confusing). The post format was set to &#8220;Image&#8221;, well&#8230; because memes will be single/multi-image posts. The first thing I faced that this case Dory will jump to my main landing page as it will become the latest post.</p>
<h2>Homepage exclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Maybe not a big deal, but as these posts will not have a featured image and it seems the excerpt, which shows up by default will not display the one and only image, the whole item looks odd. so I decided that the posts from this category should be excluded from the main listing page. A short search told me this is not something WP supports by default. There is a plugin for that (as for many other things), but I felt it an overkill for such a simple task. Same time, the fewer plugins you use the lower the overall complexity will be and because of this, I try to use as few plugins as possible. Further investigations lead me to the solution to supplement the theme&#8217;s functions. You can enter into theme file editor through Appearance menu&#8217;s Editor option. Then on the right side, you can find (probably, not true for all versions and all themes) Theme Functions (functions.php). You can exclude one or more categories from the main listing page adding the following lines to the end of the file.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<pre>function exclude_category( $query ) {
    if ( $query-&gt;is_home() &amp;&amp; $query-&gt;is_main_query() ) {
        $query-&gt;set( 'cat', '-33' );
    }
}
add_action( 'pre_get_posts', 'exclude_category' );</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You may ask &#8220;what the heck is happening here?&#8221;. Well, we declare a function called <strong><em>exclude_category</em></strong> which performs a check if the current query is the query for the blog homepage and if it is the main query. If both statements evaluate to true, then we exclude the memes category from the query. The only information you need is the category ID which you can find out from the URL when you are editing it (&#8230;&amp;tag_ID=33&#8230; in my case). The minus sign before the category ID indicates that this is an exclusion. When WordPress is rendering our page after creating the query object, but before running it calls the hook called&nbsp;<strong><em>pre_get_posts&nbsp;</em></strong>which calls our function. The exclusion takes effect and from now on the posts from the <em>memes&nbsp;</em>category will not show up on the homepage.</p>
<h2>Custom memes category page</h2>
<p>Now when I checked the <em>Memes</em>&nbsp;listing page and what I saw is that the posts are still not showing up properly. It turned out that the theme uses the same setting for the category pages as the homepage to determine if it should show the whole posts or just the excerpts in the list. Because of the aforementioned reasons, we have to do something with this too. A little bit of research revealed that on rendering a category page, it looks for templates in the following order: <em>category-slug.php ‚Üí category-id.php ‚Üí category.php ‚Üí archive.php ‚Üí index.php</em>. In my theme, the <em>archive.php</em> template is the one which was responsible for rendering the Memes category page, so the only thing I had to do is to make a copy of it, rename it to <em>category-memes.php</em>&nbsp;and make some changes.</p>
<p>The original archives.php look like:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php
/**
 * The template for displaying archive pages.
 *
 *
 *
 * @package Nisarg
 */
get_header(); ?&gt;
	&lt;div class="container"&gt;
		&lt;div class="row"&gt;
			&lt;?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?&gt;
				&lt;header class="archive-page-header"&gt;
					&lt;?php
						the_archive_title( '&lt;h3 class="archive-page-title"&gt;'.__( 'Browsed by', 'nisarg' ).'&lt;br&gt;', '&lt;/h3&gt;' );
						the_archive_description( '&lt;div class="taxonomy-description"&gt;', '&lt;/div&gt;' )
					?&gt;
				&lt;/header&gt;&lt;!-- .page-header --&gt;
				&lt;div id="primary" class="col-md-9 content-area"&gt;
					&lt;main id="main" class="site-main" role="main"&gt;
					&lt;?php /* Start the Loop */
					while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
						/*
						 * If you want to disaplay only excerpt, file content-excerpt.php will be used.
						 * Include the Post-Format-specific template for the content.
						 * If you want to override this in a child theme, then include a file
						 * called content-___.php (where ___ is the Post Format name) and that will be used instead.
						 */
						$post_display_option = get_theme_mod( 'post_display_option', 'post-excerpt' );

						if ( 'post-excerpt' === $post_display_option ) {
							get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', 'excerpt' );
						} else {
							get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', get_post_format() );
						}
					endwhile;
					nisarg_posts_navigation(); ?&gt;
			&lt;?php else : ?&gt;
				&lt;?php get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', 'none' ); ?&gt;
			&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
				&lt;/main&gt;&lt;!-- #main --&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #primary --&gt;
			&lt;?php get_sidebar( 'sidebar-1' ); ?&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--.row--&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--.container--&gt;
&lt;?php get_footer(); ?&gt;</pre>
<p>After some decluttering the result is:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php
/**
 * The template for displaying memes category pages.
 *
 *
 *
 * @package Nisarg
 */
get_header(); ?&gt;
	&lt;div class="container"&gt;
		&lt;div class="row"&gt;
			&lt;?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?&gt;
				&lt;div id="primary" class="col-md-9 content-area"&gt;
					&lt;main id="main" class="site-main" role="main"&gt;
					&lt;?php /* Start the Loop */
					while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
						get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', get_post_format() );
					endwhile;
					nisarg_posts_navigation(); ?&gt;
			&lt;?php else : ?&gt;
				&lt;?php get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', 'none' ); ?&gt;
			&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
				&lt;/main&gt;&lt;!-- #main --&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #primary --&gt;
			&lt;?php get_sidebar( 'sidebar-1' ); ?&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--.row--&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--.container--&gt;
&lt;?php get_footer(); ?&gt;</pre>
<p>As you may see I have removed the unnecessary &#8220;Browsed by&#8221; part and removed the excerpt possibility.</p>
<p>So good so far. There is a separate menu point for the &#8220;Memes&#8221;, the posts do not show up on the homepage and their category page displays them properly.</p>
<p>There is only one thing remaining. <a href="https://jetpack.com/">Jetpack</a> does good work in the comments section, auto-sharing on twitter and sending notification emails on new posts. However, when published Dory I realized that maybe my readers would not want to be notified by each and every new meme.</p>
<h2>Exclusion from the notifications</h2>
<p>Searching for such an option proved ineffectual so I turned again to good ol&#8217; Google. Shortly after I added this couple of lines of code to the end of my <em>functions.php.</em></p>
<pre>add_filter( 'jetpack_subscriptions_exclude_these_categories', 'exclude_these' );
function exclude_these( $categories ) {
	$categories = array( 'memes' );
	return $categories;
}</pre>
<p>I won&#8217;t waste many words on this, the code is self-explanatory and does the trick.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all. Not a big deal from a technical perspective but it was fun. Depending on your technical savviness the things in this post can range from &#8220;black magic&#8221; to &#8220;piece of cake&#8221;. Whichever is the case thanks for reading and please share your thoughts with me in the comments about WordPress. Oh, and please let me know if I should go on this geeky road further or get back to the stories of the good ol&#8217; days (I have both on my list).</p>

<p>Thank you and enjoy the brand new <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/memes/">MEMES</a> section.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Last week I was talking(whining) about my blogging struggles, so there come the solutions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I was talking(whining) about my <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/">blogging struggles</a>, so there come the solutions. Also, thank you for the encouragement I received, good to know that I am not alone with schedule problems. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>Posting schedule</h2>
<p>My posting frequency so far was two posts per week, one content-based and one meme based. I like to work on both, but the way I was doing it is very inefficient. Living from post to post and write and publish in last minute is not the desired path. I am far from being satisfied with the quality of some of my posts and the best description I can give to them is funny/entertaining (well, most of the times :)). I want to shoot for writing quality content (Rockstar Quality maybe?), using more time, more research and going more in depth.</p>
<p>We are always told that post often and post consistently. That is how great success will come. While this is definitely true it seems that this is not the only way. As it turned out the urge to meet this recommendation did nothing good for my content and pushed me into the struggle. Then I remembered the <a href="https://doyouevenblog.com/podcast/1/">first podcast episode</a> I heard from <a href="https://twitter.com/doyouevenblog">Pete McPherson</a> over at <a href="https://doyouevenblog.com/">DoYouEvenBlog.com</a> which he recorded with our fellow financial blogger <a href="https://www.physicianonfire.com/">PhysicianOnFire</a>. At some point, he was talking about that it is a shame that a lot of newbies quit very soon and asked the question why don&#8217;t they reduce posting frequency instead to experiment what works for them and what does not. Pete gives some more tips <a href="https://doyouevenblog.com/blog-post-schedule/">here</a>, definitely worth reading.</p>
<p>This is exactly what I will do. Starting with January I will post only one or two posts per month. I hope that this will help to allocate more time for working on my articles which will be able to provide more value to my readers. Same time it will force me to focus more on the topics. In the past I was picking them randomly, however, I had a long list of potential titles before started blogging. I will combine them with my newer list and choose the most interesting dozen of them. Also, I can not promise that there will not be any random post, like the last (and only, so far) <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/tuesday-rant-six-figure-problem/">rant</a>(?).</p>
<h2><img class="wp-image-609 aligncenter" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/notebook-428293_640-300x198.jpg" alt="Notebook" width="400" height="264"></h2>
<h2>Filling blank spaces</h2>
<p>Following the path I described above I still afraid that the lack of weekly fresh stuff will make my tiny reader base abandon the site, so I knew that I have to find out something. Taking into account this fact and combining it with my personal interests I came to the solution that I will fill the void with series and guest posts.</p>
<h3>Series</h3>
<p>For a while, I was thinking about this and came up with two ideas. The first one is purely fueled by personal interests and I have already reached out to two fellow bloggers who accepted my participation request and have some more on my list to reach out. This will be called <strong>&#8220;Coders of FInance&#8221;</strong> and as you probably guessed, I will interview programmers and IT professionals about their lives, jobs, and their FI journey.</p>
<p>The second topic is much more tricky, I feel that it will be a challenge to find participants. The series can be called <strong>&#8220;World on FIRE&#8221;</strong>, but this is not carved in stone. We get a huge amount of information about FIRE strategies and most of them are very US specific. The fact that I am a non-US dweller myself and that I bet a lot of other members of our community has a healthy amount of financial voyeurism gave me the idea of starting a post series about FIRE strategies, vehicles, possibilities in other countries.</p>
<h3>Guest posts</h3>
<p>This is probably not a big surprise, everybody does it. I have already collected 5-6 titles which I find very promising, will see if someone would be interested in writing about them. Don&#8217;t want to share them at this point, but trust me these will be special <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Hey, you forgot about Funny Friday</h3>
<p>I have a confession. I am a meme addict. Same time I am not that dumb to stop making these which brought probably some of you alone to my site. But that series in its current state is not the best possible way, so be prepared, this week I will do a &#8220;Best Of&#8221; compilation and then I will shut it down. But don&#8217;t be afraid, my financial memes will come back next year in a new form, I have something in mind, just have to find out in the holidays how should I achieve that.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-611" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/darts-102919_640-300x200.jpg" alt="Darts" width="400" height="266"></p>
<h2>Goals for 2018</h2>
<p>So just to summarize and finish off this year here are my blogging goals for the next year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay in blogging and make posting work</li>
<li>Start the aforementioned series</li>
<li>Bring fun into the FIRE community through memes</li>
<li>Receive my first guest post invitation (without asking)</li>
<li>See one of my articles end up featured on Rockstar Finance</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ok, that&#8217;s all folks. I will spend the holidays focusing on quality family time and working under the hood in my very limited free time so stay tuned for the Funny Friday &#8211; Best Of Edition this Friday as that will be my last post this year.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hope that I don‚Äôt have to introduce this legendary track to anyone, but if you somehow managed to live without knowing it, please press play now. For a while I did not know what should be the title of this post, then while working on it suddenly it started to play on <a href="http://www.deezer.com/">Deezer</a> and I knew that is it. The perfect summary of the struggle of my last two weeks. Hint: this post is not about moving.</p>

<p>As we are getting closer to the end of the year it seems that there are two recurring topics which bloggers write about these days. They are the reflection on the past year and goals for the next one. I am not an exception, these questions dug themselves heavily into my brain. Even some may have noticed that Tuesday I broke my posting schedule for the first time. This has two reasons. For one I was curious how would it affect my OCD <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The other is that I was not sure if I really want to publish this post, but finally decided to do so.</p>
<p>Today I am three months into blogging. It could be ‚Äúnot a big deal‚Äù for some of you, but for someone who has a long history of procrastination and giving things up for me, it is a big thing. When I started this hobby I was really curious how long can I get with it. My promise was that I should stick to it for at least a year, but then this reflection season hit me and forced me into the evaluation of the past three months. This process led to the aforementioned question. So, let me share my findings.</p>
<h2>The numbers</h2>
<p>Some bloggers share these type of reports monthly or quarterly. I did not do it so far because I felt that my numbers are nothing like someone should brag about, but to show the complete picture I decided to share them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Published posts: 26 (12 of them in the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/funny-friday/">Funny Friday series</a>)</li>
<li>All time views: 1477 (by 736 visitors)</li>
<li>Email subscribers: 2 (however I was thinking about reaching out if they are real persons, whatever, THANK YOU!)</li>
<li>Followers: 5 via WordPress, 192 via Twitter (THANK YOU ALL!)</li>
<li>Most popular post:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/tuesday-rant-six-figure-problem/">A Tuesday Rant ‚Äì The Six Figure Problem</a></li>
<li>Best views ever: October 10, when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/the-best-budget-i-never-had/">The Best Budget I Never Had</a> was published</li>
<li>(Update: <a href="https://esimoney.com/">ESI Money</a> sabotaged the last stat by sharing <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/my-stuff-evaluation-ruleset/">My Stuff Evaluation Ruleset</a> on twitter and pushed it to December 13. Thanks, ESI <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</li>
<li>Best referrers: <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://rockstarfinance.com/">RockstarFinance</a> (directory &amp; forums)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see the results are not stellar, but at least they pretty much align with my marketing efforts. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>The achievements</h2>
<p>While I did not have predefined goals about the points in the&nbsp;previous section, I had some less quantitative ones.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep blogging for at least a year &#8211; three months check, so good so far</li>
<li>Learn the technical background of blogging &#8211; basic level reached</li>
<li>Become part of the community &#8211; there is space for improvement&nbsp;in terms of activity, but good enough I think</li>
<li>Make connections &#8211; I got in touch with many wonderful people and even some of my hero bloggers know about my existence, I can say that I am satisfied</li>
<li>Appear on <a href="http://rockstarfinance.com/gossip/">RockstarFinance</a> &#8211; achieved this, however only made it to the gossip section: HaltCatchFire turns $$$ bloggers into <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/funny-friday-rushmore-edition/">Memes</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>The struggles</h2>
<p>And we finally got to the part which made the title question a consideration at all. As seen in many posts I can only echo the saying &#8220;it&#8217;s all about time&#8221;. I can not say that I was not warned, so please when someone tells you that blogging requires a lot of time believe them. I was told that you should not start a blog if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are bad at time management/lack of free time &#8211; check</li>
<li>you have small children in da house &#8211; double check</li>
<li>won‚Äôt do it for free &#8211; I am ok with this</li>
</ul>
<p>My biggest concern is not numbers, achievements, etc, but the feeling that what I produced so far is not the best quality stuff I could provide. When I reread my articles I find them entertaining at most. Have to admit that most of the time I am living from post to post. Was not a single case when I have put together an article in the two hours before publishing. I had two prewritten articles in my buffer when I started and I used both of them so far. So, I have a writing problem&#8230;</p>
<p>Same time I am a geeky guy and have to admit that setting up the blog, playing with plugins and testing the performance was one of the funniest things in the whole process. I am more or less satisfied with the current setup, but it has endless possibilities for improvement (and having fun).</p>
<p>The third point here is socializing. I still don‚Äôt want to enter into the Facebook world and have no idea what Pinterest and Instagram good for, but I really fell in love with Twitter and would be good to be more active there. The other area is forums where I see a great opportunity for having meaningful conversations with like-minded people.</p>
<h2>The decision</h2>
<p>I would be a liar if I‚Äôd say that quit blogging has not crossed my mind. To be honest, sometimes it seemed the only logical decision. But it does not matter how much I was thinking about it, I just can‚Äôt. I have started and quit many things over the years and most of them I did not mind at all. But I have a feeling, a voice inside my head which constantly tells me ‚Äúdo not quit‚Äù. Thus, I came to the only viable conclusion. If I want to stay in blogging I have to redesign my process, my habits and the way I handle the things. So, if you were worried until this point, calm down, you won‚Äôt losing me. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>In terms of changes stay tuned, I will tell everything next week in my last post of the year. You will be surprised <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
