										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Ahoy, matey!</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You probably came here for some funny stories about <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/funny-friday-black-friday-edition/">Jack Sparrow</a> and his homies. I have to tell ya, that you will have no luck this time as the title is just a (shark)clickbait. Unfortunately, this situation depicts the actual crypto world more accurately than you would think. Most of the people who venture into this strange land of uncertainty are daydreaming about the romantic, entertaining, happy ending stories. But I have to tell ya, there lies more under the surface. This dreaded battlefield is much darker, more contradictional, full of blood, treachery, and conspiracy. Very much alike the Caribbean sea was in the real</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Piracy"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Golden Age of Piracy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So, avast ye. Let&#8217;s head to the crows nest and hoist the Jolly Roger! We&#8217;re setting sail for the Cryptobbean sea!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bet you now think that this guy went crazy. I assure you this is not the case. After examining the crypto topic for a while and reading the good, the bad and the ugly, I wanted to put the things into a different perspective. There are typically two types of articles. The ones which tell you that crypto is the new black, and you just cannot ignore it because that is the holy grail which will evolve the financial world into its next level of existence. Oh and of course that you have to jump on the bandwagon, otherwise, you are damned and will remain in the stone-age forever. The other side is where everyone tries to emphasize the values and the rock-solid belief in the current financial system which permeates the economy of the world. These people tirelessly reminding you that this crypto phenomenon is just a mirage, a house of cards, a Ponzi scheme brought to you by the Devil himself (or worse).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is extremely hard to decide which side is right and which is wrong as the waves of information are so contradictory. If you ask me (maybe you are not, but I will tell you anyway), both and neither. To better understand my standpoint lets wrap up the facts a little bit (and don&#8217;t forget to start the background music :)).</span></p>
<p><iframe title="ALESTORM - Shipwrecked | Napalm Records" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ggyC0FOzqHM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Captain Morgan</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have ever held a glass in your hand of the golden liquid called, Original Spiced Gold then you have already met his name. The good ol’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morgan">Henry Morgan</a> is grinning at you from the label with his badass smile. He is probably the most famous pirate who ever sailed the Seven Seas. Why is this relevant, you may ask? Well, me hearties, there is an equally famous, legendary and even more mystical &#8220;captain&#8221; on the Cryptobbean sea. He is called</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Satoshi Nakamoto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. No one knows who he(or she?) really is, but he was the one who published the source code of the first cryptocurrency and wrote his famous whitepaper “</span><a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” on 31th of October in 2008. He sounded his voice a few times since then and faded into the mist again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are multiple gossips in circulation out there about his identity. My favorite prospect is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo">Nick Szabo</a>, and not just because he has Hungarian blood in his veins too. He is an extremely smart cryptographer, a true believer, supporter and influencer of the crypto tech scene. If you want some proof of these statements just check out</span><a href="https://tim.blog/2017/06/04/nick-szabo/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this interview made by Tim Ferriss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or read this very interesting piece from him, called</span><a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelling Out: The Origins of Money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I think no more words needed on this, so let&#8217;s move on.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Battlefield</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as centuries ago on the Caribbean there is a raging war on the Cryptobbean sea these days. The opponents are all over the battlefield. At one side, like the navy in the old times, there are the authorities who are fighting against the whole crypto phenomenon. They try their best to ban, regulate and hamstring the other players in the game in the interest of guarding their estates (fiat currencies and the ruling financial system) and keep their valuation intact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there is the other side, the pirates of the Cryptobbean. You may incorrectly assume that they are all the same, but alas, not all kind of pirates created equal. There are at least three groups we should distinguish.</span></p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter wp-image-707" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/crypto_skull.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401"></h3>
<h3><b>Privateers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in time, they were private persons with ships, often ex-soldiers, semi-employed by one of the great empires. They had the so-called letter of marque, which encouraged and allowed them to attack and capture enemy ships and take them as prizes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of the modern crypto world, I see them as the perfect analogy for the numerous developer groups and their organizations. They take the original idea of the blockchain and build new solutions on it. Despite they are following the rules (especially the codex) and laws they are fighting both against the authorities and each other in hope of the greater profit. Just like in the old times there are completely law-abiding ones but there are also profit-seeking, bloodthirsty bastards amongst their ranks.</span></p>
<h3><b>Buccaneers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These rugged, tough folks were selling their services to the highest bidder and had no regrets (and probably no soul). They were plundering coastal towns, took their possessions and often burned them down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I recognize these people these days as the swindlers of the crypto world. Seemingly they are similar to the previous group but have no ethics and nothing valuable to show up in the end. They are the ultimate scammers, who have the only intention to rip you off through fraudulent products, Ponzi schemes, and worthless ICO-s.</span></p>
<h3><b>Corsairs</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the Barbary privateers belonging to distant and unknown empires. They were dreaded as they did not know mercy or law besides their own. Calling a privateer on this name was a huge offense so you could guess the nature of their reputation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays these are the often mentioned hackers, who does not sow just harvest. They are tirelessly searching for the security holes of exchanges, online wallets, and any other opportunities to take advantage of the anonymity and the irreversibility of the crypto transactions. They are heavily responsible for the lack of trust in the crypto assets.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Flagships</b></h2>
<h3><img class="aligncenter wp-image-708" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/flagship-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401"></h3>
<h3><b>The Satisfaction</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the name of the flagship of the aforementioned Captain Morgan. Needless to say, this is the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a> in our little analogy. The first and most well-known cryptocurrency in present existence. It is not the fastest and far from perfection, has its struggles and hardships, but there is a crew onboard working tirelessly at the pumps to expel the water leaking into the ship. Seeing their endeavors we can still state that there is hope that these technical improvements will bring back the glory of Bitcoin, beyond its current hyper-volatile speculatory nature.</span></p>
<h3><b>Queen Anne&#8217;s Revenge</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This name probably sounds familiar to most of you. It was the flagship of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbeard">Edward Teach</a> or better known as Blackbeard. Despite I cannot point a single similarity between this dreaded pirate and the weird young Russian genius, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin">Vitalik Buterin</a> this ship symbolize <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> in our little story. It follows closely the former one in popularity but in some aspects, it is a totally different animal. Bitcoin was developed as an alternative to old-school money. Ethereum is more of a platform which provides a programming language which enables the creation of smart contracts/applications and fuels the ecosystem with its own currency (Ether).</span></p>
<h2><b>The Endgame</b></h2>
<h3><b>Henry Morgan, Edward Teach or Ching Shih?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you have the basics. The table is set. The battle is on. I do not fool myself or anyone else telling I have the slightest idea who will win or survive at least this battle. Of course, will not close this article without some thoughts on the outcome. As I told that I cannot see the future, I will only paint a picture for your mental eyes about the fate of these iconic leaders. I truly believe that it depicts the possible outcomes pretty accurately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morgan">Henry Morgan</a> fought a lot of battles. won and lost, arrested and escaped, paroled and even had a semi-legal political career in the New World. Lived a very controversial life but finally, he was defeated by his own demons. A licentious lifestyle packed with gambling and heavy drinking made him walk the plank of his own ship of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbeard">Blackbeard</a> had his share of battles and wrangles with the law, but unlike Hanry Morgan, he fought until the end. After the Queen Anne&#8217;s Revenge run aground a sandbar and appeared to be damaged beyond repair he made the Adventure his flagship and returned to piracy despite receiving a pardon. The death came for him in the name of Lieutenant Robert Maynard, who chased and defeated his team using deception. He fought with all his power, but soldiers outnumbered him. Later they examined his corpse, noting that it had been shot five times and cut about twenty. What a spirit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ching_Shih">Ching Shih&#8217;s</a> story is a little bit different. It could be an early retirement success story by itself ( shout out if you want to hear her detailed tale <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ). Her story started in China where she worked as a prostitute then married to a well known pirate captain. She took part in the family business and after the death of her husband, she emerged into the leading position. Under her government, the Red Flag Fleet became unconquerable and was thriving. Whole empires feared their power. Long story short she was offered and accepted an amnesty later and became one of the few captains who retired from piracy. She was accepted and granted privileges by the government and lived happily ever after. Ok, not forever, but unlike the others, she died in bed surrounded by her family.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="ALESTORM - Keelhauled (Official)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ta-Z_psXODw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these three outcomes are (were?) possible at this (some?) point. As someone who is charmed by the idea of financial independence and early retirement, I feel obliged to put my bets on the latter one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, me hearties! What do ya think? How will the story of the Pirates of the Cryptobbean come to an end? I bet we will see a lot of keelhauling amongst them. There will be led few mutiny where the captain will walk the plank. Of course, many of them will be captured and dance the hempen jig or rest in Davy Jones&#8217;s locker. But how many will become like Madame Cheng? Please share your opinions in the comments below (and don&#8217;t shy away from revealing your rank, ranging from &#8220;landlubber&#8221; to &#8220;old salt&#8221;).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you walk in the day of light these days it is inevitable to hear someone talking about <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/the-best-investment-advice/">investing</a> or mining Bitcoins. These mysterious things called cryptocurrencies are around for while, but only recently got into the spotlight that much that next time when you will visit your grandma she will probably asking you about them too. This popularity caused by a recent huge appreciation of Bitcoin, which caused this modern investing fever we have not seen since the 19th century gold rush.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-520" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_ask.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Afraid To Ask" width="490" height="480"></p>
<p>I will not go into details about what Bitcoin is, if you want to know more about this digitally revolutionary thing, then please check this free video course by <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking/bitcoin/v/bitcoin-what-is-it">Khan Academy</a>. It provides a lot of interesting information about the whole topic, but I think you did not come here for teachings on a Funny Friday, did you?</p>
<p>Then what will be the memes about then? Well, I took my thoughts and opinions on the topic and mixed up with some interesting facts randomly.</p>
<h2>Satoshi Nakamoto</h2>
<p>The person or the group who released the concept are hiding behind the aforementioned name. The real identity of the creator is unknown, however, there are some theories about it. One of them is that this name is a simple mixture of the names of the four tech giants SAmsung, TOSHIba, NAKAmichi and MOTOrola. My only problem with this approach is that if these four giant companies unite forces to create such a thing there is no chance that they would ever be able to keep it in secret. My favorite version is that in the real world the cryptographer, Nick Szabo is the real Satoshi. I have to admit that I am biased on this because he is a fellow Hungarian <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> but he is a real expert on the topic, even Tim Ferris recorded a podcast with him with the title <a href="https://tim.blog/2017/06/04/nick-szabo/">“The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency”</a>. He denies the statement, but I cannot blame him. I would do the same if I had approximately 1 million Bitcoins which worths ten billion dollars at current value.</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-524" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_nick_szabo.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Yoda" width="475" height="547"></h2>
<h2>Bitcoin Investing</h2>
<p>In the recent years, but especially in this year a hundreds of posts were published on the topic of Bitcoin investing. However it sounds legit for the everyday people the proud members of our community knows exactly that this is pure speculation. Of course despite this fact it can be very profitable as the change in the price of one BTC from the beginnings exceeds 200.000%. Not a bad ROI, huh?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-521" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_roi.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Shut Up" width="500" height="281"></p>
<h2>The Most Expensive Pizza Ever</h2>
<p>The first documented purchase of a good with Bitcoin was made by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Laszlo_Hanyecz">Laszlo Hanyecz</a>. He bought two Domino&#8217;s pizzas for the astonishing amount of 10.000 BTC on May 17, 2010. On todays value it would be almost $10M, hope the restaurant was wise enough to keep them. To commemorate the transaction, May 22 became the&nbsp;Bitcoin Pizza Day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-522" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_pizza.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Bad Luck Brian" width="475" height="562"></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mining</h2>
<p>Bitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger. Anyone with internet connection and proper hardware can participate, but there are giant corporations who are dominating the crypto mining world. There are huge factory buildings in China stuffed with computer parts, running all the time and make their owners wealthier and wealthier every single minute.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-525" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_mine.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="666"></p>
<h2>What Is The Future</h2>
<p>As they say &#8220;No one can predict the future&#8221;. Some say this crypto thing is just another bubble which will burst soon. Others are fanatically putting all their money into it. Who will be right in the end? Who knows. The opponents say that these &#8220;coins&#8221; has no intrinsic value. The advocates say that it has the same attributes as real gold and it will bring the digital revolution to our world. Personally, I think that both sides are right. In terms of profitability and price appreciation I think the hype is strong with this one and sooner or later the bubble will burst. On the other hand, the technology, especially the newer improved variations, like Ethereum and many others are very promising and I believe that it will bring some kind of tech revolution.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-528" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_not_sure.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Not Sure" width="552" height="414"></p>
<p><em>What do you think about the topic? Do you have BTC &#8220;investments&#8221;? Do you think it&#8217;s a bubble? Please share your thoughts with me in the comments!</em></p>
