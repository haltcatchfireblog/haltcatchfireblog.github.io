Today I can happily inform you that a couple of weeks ago I was invited to <a href="https://financial-independence.eu">Europes&#8217; best Financial Independence podcast</a>. It is a great honor, especially that this is the only podcast which I am following ever since the beginning. Needless to say, I was super anxious as this was my first occasion speaking &#8220;publicly&#8221; in English. I was lucky as <a href="https://financiallymint.com/">Araminta</a> is very professional, super kind and helped me a lot to express myself.</p>
<p>Hope you will <a href="https://financial-independence.eu/podcast/043-challenges-opportunities-reaching-fi-in-serbia-halt-catch-fire/">like this episode</a> and I was able to provide a sneak peek into how are the things going here in Serbia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When someone mentions the word &#8220;luxury&#8221; the first things which come into mind are a holiday villa, a Lamborghini, a big pool with a bar serving fancy cocktails, champagne, and caviar. Simple things like tap water, central heating or common cars would probably not appear on that list. Despite these things became common only in the last century we are taking them as granted without a second thought. Then something happens and we are facing an unpleasant reminder that these things are luxuries indeed and can be gone in a blink of an eye. I did experience a couple of these reminders in my lifetime, sometimes because of politics and sometimes because of nature.</p>
<p>I was born in a country which does not exist anymore. It had many names through the decades but you probably knew it simply as Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, I am not old enough to tell tales about the golden years, as I was born about the start of the declension, but the elders say that it had the nickname&nbsp;&#8220;Small America&#8221; amongst the neighbor countries, which tells a lot. Life was good back then but, as usually happens, politicians decided that they want to mess up the things. I don&#8217;t want to go into details if you are interested, have a look&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553038013304000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGFGX_C9TkHzYy4UoCdkM6UGrzFA">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Fuel</h3>
<p>I bet that not many eight-year-olds know what the word &#8220;embargo&#8221; means. Neither did we. Until it&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Yugoslavia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Yugoslavia&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553038013304000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFjQ3vcgUI_coaRfNNcrdaCnVUL0w">happened</a>. The first thing I remember that after the oil export got banned suddenly there was a shortage of fuel. My family owned a canary yellow&nbsp;<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/how-i-fell-in-love-with-hatchbacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.haltcatchfire.com/how-i-fell-in-love-with-hatchbacks/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553038013304000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHFKzkIGtsR7FVq45lu5a_FedIb-g">Yugo Coral 60</a>, thus we were eligible to buy some fuel. The amount was set by the government. The memory lives vividly in my mind. It was a nice warm spring day. I was standing with my father in a long row waiting for the fuel thickets at the local community building. The adults were chatting quietly about politics, jobs or how big was the fish they caught last weekend.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1409 size-full" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/drum-2523833_640-e1553852846716.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="371"></p>
<p>A couple of hours later we left the building with four small pieces of paper the size of a credit card. Each granted the right to buy 5 liters of petrol at the local gas station. That amount had to last for a month. To be totally honest I cannot recall if we used it or simply sold those valuable pieces of paper to those who were more in need of fuel. I&nbsp;don&#8217;t remember the exact numbers as the value of money was <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/three-financial-lessons/">ambiguous back then</a>, but according to the&nbsp;prices I found online, filling that fuel tank would easily cost a monthly salary. We did not really have&nbsp;many places to visit after all&#8230;</p>
<h3>Supplies</h3>
<p>Following the banning of oil import there came a total ban of importing and exporting of any goods. We were lucky as we were living in the northern part of the country where the agriculture was strong and the food supplies were abundant. I don&#8217;t think that we ever had problems with the basic ingredients like flour, sugar, milk,&nbsp;and eggs. However, the other stuff we were used to buying as kids (candy, chocolate, chewing gum, and juice) slowly disappeared from the stores along with many other things. I remember walking around the corner store having a pile of stuff in one shelf and another one a couple of meters away. The whole supply of my hometown would fit into a single supermarket I guess but at least we had food on the table and that is something not everyone in the country was able to state in those times&#8230;</p>
<h3>Electricity</h3>
<p>Fast forward a couple of years and we get to the next conflict the politicians thought a good idea. Exactly twenty years ago, on the 24th of March, we were standing in the schoolyard listening to our teachers telling us that the school will be closed until further notification. We did not really get the situation so with the simple message that school is skipped today, so we simply walked home. I almost arrived home when the first sirens sounded&#8230;</p>
<p>That was the longest summer vacation we ever had. It lasted over five months. Again we were lucky as in the northern area the situation was not that bad. There was a dusk-to-dawn curfew and we&nbsp;had to be alert when the sirens sounded. Apart from that, it was silent, lazy summertime. We did what every other kid to kill time. We played video games. Both I and my best friend had a PC back then and we also were members of a computer club. Why is this important? In those days the country was short on energy supplies. Because of that, there were planned blackouts through the day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1412 size-full" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/light-1030988_640-e1553852976862.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="346"></p>
<p>Sometimes it meant there were eight hours a day when we did not have electricity. Sometimes there were only eight hours when we had. The trick was that our town was divided into several districts and only one had a blackout at a specific time. Our house, my friends&#8217; house, and the computer club were located in three distinct districts so we always had a place for gaming. The transfer of savegame files was a little bit problematic but we solved it. If you are curious about the transfer bandwidth, the top speed was about 2.88 megabyte per minute. You can easily calculate this if you take into account two kids with two bikes, a ten-minute trip and a twenty pack of floppy disks <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Natural Gas</h3>
<p>My next story happened ten years later. This time it was not our country which engaged in international conflict but there was a knockabout between Russia and Ukraine. As a result, they shut the gas tap. We were living in a flat back then which got central heating from the local heating plant which was running on that natural gas. The lack of heating was not a funny thing in the cold January weather. Luckily we had an electric heater which made the situation bearable but it was obvious that it won&#8217;t be a final solution. We were ready to temporarily move back to our hometown where our parents had those good old school wood burning furnaces. It did not happen as after one or two days the heat service providers changed to diesel-fueled heating. The service went on but the smog was horrible in the following days until the conflict ended.</p>
<h3>Water</h3>
<p>The last example was independent of&nbsp;any conflicts or political activity (if you do not take into account the conspiracy theories about weather control machines). Four years ago we moved into our current home. Like many first time buyers, we were inexperienced and wanted to settle down as soon as possible instead of searching for years. After seeing a dozen horrible options we went for the one which we thought good enough. The decision was almost perfect. Almost.</p>
<p>Our new home is located in that area of the city where tap water is not accessible yet. The work of laying down the pipes was in progress by the time in the neighboring streets. Then suddenly they moved on. The circle was not finished so we thought that they will continue the work next spring. They did not. It was not a problem as our home, as all the others around, has a dug well which provides us with running water. Then two years ago one day the running water stopped running.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1410 size-full" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/clean-21479_640-e1553852872315.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="346"></p>
<p>It was exactly the week when my wife and our newborn baby daughter was about to arrive home from the hospital. If you think that your marriage is rock solid and can stand anything I would recommend telling your significant other that after spending a couple of days in a hospital, with no less task than bringing a new life to this world, that she can not have a warm shower and that you have no idea when will the running water return. Success guaranteed <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>A couple of days and a few service brigades later we got know that the water levels dropped in the area. Our well was at a critical depth level and cannot be fixed. Fortunately, our neighbors were helpful and they let us connect our system with their garden tap for a couple of weeks. In the end, we had to get professional help to dig a new well. A couple of weeks and a&nbsp;huge pile of money later the water is running happily ever since but the &#8220;happy&#8221; memories will remain with us forever.</p>
<p>As you can see, things can go south in a blink of an eye. So, when you next start to feel that you need that latest phone or another hundred TV channels, please stay for a moment and think about what are your real necessities in life and once you discover that you are doing well I bet you will start smiling <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><em>PS: thanks for the inspiration and for this walk down at memory lane for <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/when-luxuries-become-necessities/">J$ and his Monday post</a>&nbsp;<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy fellas!</p>
<p>Long time no see.</p>
<p>As anyone can tell, this second half of the year <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wake-me-up-when-september-ends/">wasn&#8217;t my most productive</a> period in terms of blogging and otherwise. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am not apologizing and have no regrets. Many times I exchanged &#8220;blogging time&#8221; for simply hanging out with my wife or playing late with my daughters. Life is about priorities and we all have the same scarce resource of time which we decide where to invest. After all, I am just one of the <a href="https://indeedably.com/fire-extinguisher">grey pigeons</a> of financial blogging, writing gibberish to random strangers on the interwebz. In some cases, a discussion arises and we get to know each other even more. Sometimes we even get friends. And when this happens it is wonderful.</p>
<p>These days there is a lot of criticism about (financial) bloggers in general and especially about this phenomenon I like to protect, the FIRE movement. Some arguments are legit and some are invalid. I have my opinions but who am I to judge? Perception is a wonderful thing after all <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> All I can do is that I try to be honest with myself and others and stay on the <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/2018/12/14/the-financial-content-creator-ethics-pledge/">righteous&nbsp;side</a>. While I left the consistent publishing schedule far behind (if I ever followed it&#8230;) making all the SEO and blogging gods fretful and probably acquired some bonus points on the &#8220;worlds worst blogger&#8221; contest, I really wanted to publish something meaningful as the closing post of this year.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1243" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1243" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1243 size-large" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/gandalf-1024x576.jpg" alt="Gandalf" width="640" height="360"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1243" class="wp-caption-text">Wisdom is always welcome from trustable sources</figcaption></figure>
<p>Don&#8217;t run away I will not pull out my red pencils and count the achieved and failed blogging goals for the year. Neither will I introduce you to the secret five-point&nbsp;list which will bring you the ultimate new-year-resolution-maker-goal-setting-process. In a <a href="https://indeedably.com/fire-extinguisher/#comment-337">recent&nbsp;discussion</a>, I stated that &#8220;the best things what you can earn in this community is friendship and knowledge I think&#8221;. Then somehow the long discontinued <a href="https://www.1500days.com/category/gratitude/">Gratitude series on 1500days.com</a>&nbsp;popped into my mind and I&nbsp;thought that I will combine these two thoughts and wrap up the year with a gratitude post.</p>
<p>I believe in the power of words and I love when I get introduced to new (or at least new to me) words or expressions. For one of these words, I am grateful to a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/the-falcon-method">fellow Hungarian investor, David</a>. I learned a lot of other things but one of my favorite expressions also came from him. It is &#8220;selective contrarian&#8221;. It is widely used in investment terms but I think you can also use it for your overall outlook on the world. When I spend my time as not a creator but a consumer of content (most of the time) I always searching for such unique voices in the big mass of ideas, teachings, and preachings. Every now and then I find one.&nbsp;And when this happens it is wonderful.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to say goodbye to this blogging year by expressing my gratitude to all the folks who are kind to my heart and enriched my life on a way. Their contributions are sometimes ideas I found interesting, entertaining or educating. These brought me smiles, improved my thinking or even drove my financial decisions. And in some rare cases, the ideas brought me epiphanies or left me seriously thinking about my life and my future. While the former is&nbsp;important too&nbsp;the revelations brought by the latter are game changers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1241" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/real_mvp.jpg" alt="you da real mvp" width="250" height="250"></p>
<p>Without any further ado let me introduce you to the voices and ideas which contributed most to my mindset this year. The list is probably not complete and there is no importancy, alphabetical or other ranking, just the order they pop into my mind.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com">J$</a></h3>
<p>Let’s kick off the list with a true rockstar. To be honest I never expected that when you ping a top blogger he will actually answer. But Jay did. Every. Single. Time. With a joking tone one-liner or a longer description if I asked something. And sometimes with a much-needed encouragement.</p>
<p>In terms of wisdom, I can point my finger on two things.</p>
<p>One is that sometimes you have to “Let It Go”. Even if that is a big project which was built by yourself from scratch. It does not matter how much you want to keep it if it keeps you away from things which are most important to you it is time to say farewell.</p>
<p>The other thing is his weirdo <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/why-im-obsessed-with-cemeteries/">obsession with cemeteries</a>. While I don’t totally share this emotion I can relate to the feeling and nothing puts your life more into perspective than facing your mortality and remembering that <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/deadly-finance/">sooner or later the road will come to an end</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.1500days.com">Mr.1500</a></h3>
<p>Carl is another awesome guy, whom I also thought is out of my reach but interestingly he replied to my emails every now and then. I cannot really point on a single idea of his but his story as it flows gives me inspiration. And peace. There are dozens of posts out there about the fear of retiring because folks just don’t know what to do with their life. Carl’s post-retirement life is the living example that I should not worry. He kept coding, he improved his health and did all kind of fun and <a href="https://www.1500days.com/i-left-my-job-one-year-ago-heres-how-its-going/">cool stuff with his family</a>. Let’s talk about mapping fulfilling future&#8230;</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.keepthrifty.com">Chris Durheim</a></h3>
<p>Chris is also a programmer and a fellow father with daughters. You see a pattern here? Yeah, I like to search for like-minded folks, let’s go on. So, Chris took a one-year mini-retirement and then extended it. Most of the times you read only the good about such stories. But where is the bad and the ugly? Well, Chris had to realize that it is not always <a href="https://www.keepthrifty.com/mini-retirement-mental-breakdown/">rainbows and unicorns</a>. But still, the take-home message is that if you go beyond your comfort zone you can find personal growth even if you <a href="https://www.keepthrifty.com/financial-failure-personal-success/">fail on a way or succeed on another</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://othalafehu.com">OthalaFehu</a></h3>
<p>If you would ask me to point my finger on a true badass in the community I would pick him. His posts are not long winded so I will try to wrap up his wisdom the same way:</p>
<p><a href="https://othalafehu.com/tales-crimeside/">Change is possible</a>,<br />
<a href="https://othalafehu.com/personal-story/">Discipline is important</a>,<br />
<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/prepping-for-non-preppers-101/">Preparedness is golden</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org">ChiefMomOfficer</a></h3>
<p>Liz is an incredible person, a true energy bomb. Sometimes I start being suspicious if she had a secret interview with Hermione Granger for her <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/women-on-fire/">Woman On Fire</a> series but she never published it to keep the fact in secret that she passed on that <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Time-Turner">time turner</a> to her so she can have more than 24 hours a day. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> She published dozens of educative posts but the one which is closest to my heart tells the <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/2017/03/06/going-into-crisis-mode-when-it-all-goes-to-hell-a-story-of/">story of their fight with death</a>. Yeah, sometimes it is sobering to remember that bad things can happen with good people so having an emergency fund and a plan B at hand is always a good idea.</p>
<h3><a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Groovy</a></h3>
<p>As I told you I like learning new expressions and the <a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/am-i-about-to-become-a-teat-sucking-layabout/">“teat sucking layabout”</a> could be the expression of the year. But there is more wisdom here than a geniusly fabricated expression. The biggest lesson for me in their story is that you can be different. You can take <a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/the-broken-windows-of-personal-finance/">ownership of your stuff</a> and you can change things if you really want. Mr. Groovy worked a government job for a long time, despite we share a similar disgust about how they are running their(?) business. He was able to make a difference just by changing his mindset, taking over control and improve himself. As a result, they enjoy post-retirement life in a location of their choice in a home they built recently. &#8220;<a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/not-lazy-slob/">Don’t embrace the sloth</a>&#8221; is huge take-home message here.</p>
<h3><a href="https://mysterymoneyman.com">MisteryMoneyMan</a></h3>
<p>MisteryMoneyMan is the other MMM whose posts I like to read. I am also a follower of his insider email series where he shares his adventures as a hustler. While I am collecting the ideas from his reportings the reason why I added him to the list is an act which is not so common, even in the FIRE community. Recently, instead of rushing on the good old corporate ladder he just <a href="https://mysterymoneyman.com/why-im-climbing-down-the-corporate-ladder/">simply climbed down a little</a> to regain some of his time and freedom. I am not working in such a hierarchy where this would be something I could do, but the idea of giving up a bigger opportunity for the greater good is something I want to keep in mind just in case a situation will ever arise. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/">AbandonedCubicle</a></h3>
<p>Cubert is a true joker, I always like to read his writings but despite he is playing with FIRE recently the area he widened my view is real estate. He owns some <a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/category/build-wealth-with-rental-properties/">rental properties</a> which he renovated mostly by himself and running an <a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/airbnb-experiment/">experiment with Airbnb</a>. These are topics which are picking my mind because of future investment possibilities so it is good to have insights on how others solve issues and share their raw numbers.</p>
<h3><a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/">CheesyFinance</a></h3>
<p>Mr. CF is a cheerful guy and I really like his original ideas and thought experiments. The “<a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/category/should-you/">should you buy a…</a>” series brought his name to this list. The idea of actually <a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/2018/08/06/should-you-buy-a-yacht/">buying a boat</a> never crossed my mind (there aren’t many wooden pirate ships out there for a reasonable price) but I have to admit that <a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/2018/08/27/should-you-buy-a-castle/">buying (or building) a castle</a> did and his numbers in this post confirm that it is not absolute insanity (like my wife thinks). An <a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/2018/09/06/should-you-buy-an-island/">island would be</a> an equally awesome thing but the financial rationality wasn’t really backed by the numbers. We have some more work to do here <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/">WhatLifeCouldBe</a></h3>
<p>Mr. &amp; Mrs. White (and their kids) are charming people. The types you sit down with for the first time and five minutes later you are having a conversation like if you know each other for ages. After I discovered the European FIRE scene through <a href="https://firehub.eu/">FIREHub.eu</a> and read about <a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2015/10/07/about-us/">their life</a> on their blog they were the first people I was speaking with in real life via Skype. When it turned out that I cannot attend the <a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/tag/fiwe/">FIWE</a>, their annual conference we agreed that we will meet sometime in person as we are living only one border away. This happened this summer and we spent a wonderful day chatting, biking, walking around, having a nice lunch and some drinks. The kids also had a great time and I am looking forward to repeating the occasion sometime next year.</p>
<p>Besides this great experience, I wanted to emphasize Mr. Ws&#8217; incredible mindset about handling obstacles. He <a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2018/09/25/i-want-to-change-the-world/">believes in making a difference</a> and that it can be started on a small scale, locally. I am always impressed when I read about <a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2018/11/21/talking-personal-finance-poor-mums/">such endeavors</a> of his. He is the living example for the saying “when there’s a will there’s a way”. We should all learn that letting our priorities drive our lives and fighting passivity are some of the best places we could invest our times.</p>
<h3><a href="https://retireinprogress.com/">RetireInProgress</a></h3>
<p>I discovered Mr. RIPs&#8217; blog earlier this year and at first, I have only read some of the latest posts. His writing style and humor caught me and I started to dig deeper. That&#8217;s how I found out about <a href="http://retireinprogress.com/category/mystory/">his origin story</a> and it blew my mind. A life packed with challenges, struggles, victories, dreams achieved and left behind. The very important lesson is that even reaching to the top, getting many coders <a href="http://retireinprogress.com/mystory7/">dream job</a> does not automatically skyrockets you to lalaland and when the magic starts to vanish you realize the golden handcuffs on your wrist. His approach to dream, work for it, test and dump it if you don’t enjoy it anymore is something more of us should adopt.</p>
<h3><a href="https://indeedably.com">{in·deed·a·bly}</a></h3>
<p>The biggest lesson here: don&#8217;t use Google when someone <a href="https://indeedably.com/normalcy/">told you so</a>… Jokes apart, {in·deed·a·bly} is a late discovery but instantly jumped to the top of my favorite list. He is one of the few bloggers who excels in storytelling and using it to make his posts more colorful. It is not just the appealing design of his blog but a very unique perspective is what sucked me into binge reading his posts. Hard to pick a single best one, I haven’t found any which isn’t inspiring, educating, entertaining or the combination of these. Maybe the most thought-provoking is which provides the framework for <a href="https://indeedably.com/financial-planning/">financial planning</a> and the funniest is the story about the <a href="https://indeedably.com/subversion/">creativity of his kids</a>. Looking forward to consuming more delicious thought food of his in the future.</p>
<h3><a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/">EarlyRetirementDude</a></h3>
<p>I had a professor back at the university teaching us Calculus I. He was a mean guy with an individual sense of humor. He was trolling us all the time and joking on our unpreparedness. I became a drop-out for the first time because of his class. But I started over and tried again. I passed his exam for the 10th time with a lot of effort and help from others. Then next year came Calculus II and he became not just the professor but the lecturer also. After a couple of lessons, I realized that I was totally wrong about him in the previous years. He wasn’t the douchebag we thought he is but we were the idiots who did not take life seriously enough. He just had a particular way of mocking us and trying to make us face with the harsh truth that we should stop whining and start working harder if we want to achieve our goals. Looking back now he may have been one of the best teachers I ever had.</p>
<p>The reason I started this introduction with this flashback is that after I started reading ER Dudes’ posts I felt the same. At first, I thought that this is an extremely smart grumpy guy who spreads his wisdom with a pinch of sarcasm all the time. Then I realized that he is just an extremely smart and extremely honest guy who shoots his wisdom towards you without a single sprinkle of bullshit. He taught me many valuable lessons about the <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/the-history-of-fier/">origins of the FI/ER movement</a> or the true <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/summary-tuesdays-reddit-interview-inventor-4-rule/">nature of the 4% rule</a>. Still, there was <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/early-retirement-expectations-unrealistic-probably-wrong/">one thought</a> which made a huge impact on my thinking and made me look at my job through a completely different set of lenses. Please read the quote and there will be no need for further explanation.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Your job’s a business transaction. You may want to sell your time to these people and they may want to buy it from you…so when you feel desperate for the door &#8211; really desperate &#8211; remember: if you want your freedom that badly, the door’s right there. Nobody’s hiding the keys. All else is a matter of compromise.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The interesting thing is that this single quote freed me up from worry. It gave a joker card in my hand. Maybe you would expect that as a result, I turned in my notice. Actually, what happened is quite the opposite. I enjoy my job more than ever. I took ownership of my stuff and I am not just drifting anymore but dictating the direction and don’t shy away anymore from saying out loud what I am thinking. When you realize that the door is actually there, you can leave whenever you want, nobody’s hiding the keys and nobody’s holding you back you will experience freedom. It is like having the FU money… except I don’t have that FU money but I know that I could find another job or I could indulge in entrepreneurship and still would be able to provide to my family. In a way I guess, this is similar to the freedom of after FIRE life.</p>
<h3><a href="https://financial-independence.eu/">Financial Independence Europe podcast</a></h3>
<p>Last but not least I wanted to add the one and only podcast to the list which I was able to stick with. I have to admit that I am not a podcast listener. I rarely do activities which makes a great fit with podcast listening. Tried to follow some in the past but until now there wasn&#8217;t a single one which was able to get me listening episode after episode. I cannot really emphasize a single piece of wisdom as all the episodes are interesting on a way. So, thank you <a href="https://financiallymint.com/">Araminta</a>, Matthias, and Alvar for treating us with many fresh ideas and perspectives. I see a big potential in reaching your goals with the podcast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are already done with the triduum of <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/who-killed-my-halloween/">Halloween, All Saints&#8217; Day and All Souls’ Day</a>. While the Halloween part got more and more popularity at our ends only in recent years the other two days were always the occasion for us to visit the graves of our loved ones. This melancholic time of the year is perfect for remembering and reflection. As the weather turns colder, the days darker, and nature slowly slips into its hibernated state our thoughts unintentionally shifts towards passing away and dying.</p>
<p>Death is a scary thing and we instinctively try to avoid even thinking about that. At least for most of us. I don’t know what has changed lately, maybe this comes with age (or maybe, as I hope, wisdom) but I am no more in that camp. I got used to thinking about death and in a strange way it calms me. Accepting that it is the law of nature, that all living things will unavoidably die at some point, in a strange way, provides me with a peace of mind. Just as thinking about the many different ways this could happen.</p>
<p>Maybe it is just the logical thinker in me but it calms me the same way as knowing that I have handled all the possible outcomes while writing computer code. While life is much more complicated than the average software it does not hurt if we build into our program a proper way of error handling. Trust me it is a very shitty thing when while running a program something goes south and when you are debugging the code and find the error all you see is a long forgotten comment /* TODO &#8211; error handling */. This is not something you want to leave as a legacy for your loved ones once the source code of your body throws an exception and enters into an infinite loop of noop().</p>
<p>Apologies, I went a little bit too nerdy, it happens every now and then. What I wanted to say is that despite it could be uncomfortable and scary, thinking about the inevitable and preparing for it properly is a must do for all of us (especially financially). Let’s face with those scenarios and draw at least a sketchy plan for handling them.</p>
<p>So what if you would die…</p>
<h2>Today</h2>
<p>Ok, now you may ask why do we start with the worst case scenario? Well, because in chronological order this is the first possible option (and maybe you will understand that this is not the worst case after all). Also this the most important scenario to prepare for especially if you leave behind some humans who are count on you. As <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/things-that-are-scarier-than-halloween/#comment-272623">someone pointed out recently</a>, financial dependence is a scary thing (yes, even more than clowns). If you are one of the two or the only breadwinner in the family, like myself, you should not understate this situation. Just ask yourself, if you would stop breathing right after you finish this sentence will your loved ones be covered and set financially to get through the unimaginably hard task of moving on with their lives?</p>
<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Put the time and effort into learning about your insurance options and shop for proper insurance applicable for your situation (term life, salary, etc… but no whole life, at least for me)!</p></blockquote>
<p>This is something I keep asking myself lately and the answer still disturbs me. Three years ago when this question started to pop up (alongside with the curiosity about retirement funding and investments) the answer came in the form of an insurance agent. One consultation and some signatures later I became the responsible, proud, and smart owner of a “whole&#8221; life policy. I was convinced that this is the financial holy grail as it not just provides you with life insurance but also accumulates “investments” and will pay you back every cent plus a “healthy&#8221; profit if you survive the contracted 30 years. I was happy with that for a while but then discovered the personal finance blogosphere and everything changed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1180" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/not_today-1.jpg" alt="Not today" width="500" height="281"></p>
<p>Now I understand how naive I was and what is the price I paid for it. So I did what anyone else would do in my situation, procrastinated the decision for another year. But as we are getting closer to the next payment of the annual premium, I finally forced myself to review this thing, put the numbers on paper and make a responsible decision. So I put together a spreadsheet with all the info, tailored some formulas and drew the lessons from the numbers.</p>
<p>Long story short, the conclusion was that as an investment it performs awfully and as an insurance, it is pretty expensive compared to the coverage it provides. I had no clue about planning for the future and possible investment vehicles back then. According to the numbers, the best case scenario where I survive the contract and get a payout the accumulated amount would be damaged by roughly 50% erosion in buying power. Also if meanwhile shit would hit the fan the payout would barely cover two years of expenses for my family left without a breadwinner&#8230; forever.</p>
<p>So, now I am shopping for a proper term life insurance and about to break that previous contract. It will mean that I will lose the first two years premium but still less than what I would lose if I keep at paying through the thirty year period. In terms of investments, I also will take the control into my hand <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> An expensive lesson but definitely an important one.</p>
<h2>Soon</h2>
<p>See, I told you that maybe today is not the worst possible scenario. I would not go into the details how would it be possible, let&#8217;s just assume you have a crystal ball and you know for sure that you have a couple of months/years left until a specific date when you will kick the bucket with a 100% confidence. Having the insurance topic, mentioned in the previous paragraphs, already handled what should you do in such a situation?</p>
<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Put your efforts into fixing anything you can and into leaving an intellectual and financial legacy which will remain here as a guide for the future!</p></blockquote>
<p>If I have learned something from such real life and fictional (books, movies) situations it is that after you accept the inevitable (finally) and the initial panic will flush away you will get a brutal clarity about what is important to you in life and what is not. Personally, I have never been in such a situation and I hope that I never will but I assume my focus would narrow around my family and their future.</p>
<p>We had a discussion about this with J$ and we agreed that both of us would start to write letters to our loved ones about our thoughts on any situation we think it would be important to the person to hear them. A letter for my daughters to help them get over the first love-sorrow or to express how proud I am at a future success moment. Another for my wife to remind herself the happy moments on nights when she feels so lonely without me. I think writing these would be a time well spent. I would spend as much time with them as I can and write these letters while they are sleeping (“<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431308/">PS I love you</a>” style).</p>
<p>On the financial field, your best guess should not be any less. Try to figure out how could you ensure their financial stability in the future. Also, you should not only create a plan and put it into work, but you also have to teach them how to maintain the system and keep it running when you won’t be there. Moreover, you could leave references and point them towards the sources you were inspired and instructed by. And last but not least encourage them to not only take your words blindly but do their own research, understand the principles, build upon them and get even better than you ever were. After all, this is what we all wish to our kids, aren’t we?</p>
<h2>On time</h2>
<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Reach FIRE asap to free your time</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an ambiguous description but you will get it when you read further. By &#8220;on time&#8221; I mean in case your life goes on like the average and your final hour come around the expected age of yours. How could you know when will it be? If you Google it, you can find out that the current life expectancy is 76 for man and 81 for women. My reaction when I read about a new actual number somewhere always was “hurray, we are living longer again&#8221;. Only recently found out that it only applies to someone who borns now and we have to search for our stats a little bit differently.</p>
<p>You can find a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html">table here</a> where you can look up your numbers or if you prefer <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/population/longevity.html">calculators here</a> is one for the same purpose. It tells me that as a 34 years old male I could expect living another 48 years and my target year could be around 82. I am kind of comfortable with this estimation, I have seen some fellas with that age and it seemed to me that they were pretty satisfied with their lives and what they have achieved.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1185 size-full" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/old_couple-e1541139119669.jpg" alt="Old couple" width="500" height="466"></p>
<p>By that time you should have applied the insurance advice from the &#8220;Today&#8221; part through the past years and maybe you did the exercises from the “Soon” part, even if it did not happen. This option is when our beloved FIRE community enters the big picture, as this is the scenario where your main focus should be reaching FIRE asap. The sooner you get there the more years will you have left for doing whatever your heart desires. Maybe I am biased on this topic and I accept that this is not the only way of living a successful life but I honestly think that this should be the basic goal for everyone.</p>
<h2>Much later</h2>
<p>There is another factor what we did not take into account in the previous scenario. According to the historical life expectancy numbers, we can observe an annual rise in the expected age by 0.2 years. This addition alone would add 9.6 years to my 82 years expectation, but there is more. This rise is caused by the improving standards of living for the population alongside with the development of medicine and science. And because of the huge amount of resources and effort channeling into these fields, it is very likely that even this rise will accelerate in the future. Besides these improvements, humans started to become more conscious about their health and the environment. We still have a long way to go on these fields but this can also boost that acceleration as many top death causes are connected with our own bad habits or pollution in general.</p>
<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Go for the hardcore FI way and NTYP</p></blockquote>
<p>What impressed me is that if you make a little bit of research you can find hundreds of ideas of the possibilities here about future life expectancy, ranging from 100 to over 200 years. Please note that many of these estimations are not originating from some science fiction movies but from legit scientists. If you think of it how many things became a reality for today which was pretty wild dreams in the last century, and even some folks were burned for such ideas a couple of centuries earlier, these numbers aren’t that insane. In my opinion, this is a possible future scenario for the humankind and I hope that this will actually happen.</p>
<p>Same time, despite the benefits of prolonged lifespans, a whole new variety of problems will arise. First of all, I am pretty sure there will be a huge debate if the whole process is morally right or not. Prolonging our lives beyond the natural range isn’t the phenomenon we call &#8220;playing God”? Or this is just the next step of the evolution of the humankind and this possibility always was there encoded into our DNA just the circumstances weren’t optimal? The answers for these questions will come from smarter folks than me. Also, the increased population will have huge requirements of resources but I hope that amongst the increased number of humans there will be even more geniuses living a much longer life to reach breakthroughs and they will solve these problems.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1197" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dr_evil.jpg" alt="Dr Evil" width="500" height="405"></p>
<p>Last but not least there is the question our financially nerdy minds would ask, how will this affect the economy, the financial system, and our beloved personal finances. Today the 4% rule is the gold standard but some folks are already more conservative with withdrawal rates. Some even say that a longer life is a big threat for a happily funded retirement but this is a problem everyone would welcome I think. So what if we start from today&#8217;s principles but we have to plan not for only a couple of decades of retirement but a century or more? I think that the definite goal, in this case, would be reaching the ideal withdrawal rate via the “Never Touch Your Principal” method. Sam wrote a good article about calculating that number <a href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/the-ideal-withdrawal-rate-for-retirement-doesnt-touch-principal/">at Financial Samurai</a>, according to his reasoning you should aim for 2.2-2.8% WR. This would change our worshipped 25x number to 40-50x in terms of nest egg accumulation. The good news is that with a prolonged life you will potentially have much more time for that accumulation phase.</p>
<p>Maybe Suze Orman has some oracle-like skills and that’s why she is echoing the 70 years barrier? By our current numbers the traditional retirement age is at two-thirds of a person&#8217;s life, early retirement age is somewhere under that but at least at the one-third mark. So if we extrapolate that to a prolonged life (and assuming that aging will slow down accordingly) when life expectancy will hit 210 years the old school retirement age would reach 140 years of age. It would be really funny to see them joking on future FIREfolks.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So here you have it, my complete life-ending scenario list. This is the first time I walked through even myself on all possibilities chronologically. It even surprised me how different our focus should be in the different scenarios. So if you want to have a bulletproof plan for the future start with preparing for “Today”, then put some thoughts into the “Soon”, set your goal according to “On time” and try to improve that towards the “Much later” case. Start today and if this article helped you secure your financial future buy me a $60 beer sometime in the next century. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><em>What about you? Which scenario is the scariest in your opinion? Which is the most probable? Which is the one you are actually preparing for? Did I miss something? Am I crazy? Will AI have an intelligence explosion by 2060 and erase humanity from the surface of the Blue Planet once and for all? Let me know in the comments and let&#8217;s have a conversation until the end of the time!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today I am happy to share you the second <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/prepping-for-non-preppers-101/">guest post</a> on this blog. To be honest I asked my friend, <a href="http://www.mysonsfather.com/">MSF</a> a couple of months ago if he wants to write the first guest post for my site but back then he was busy enjoying a sneaky blogging break and pretending that <a href="http://www.mysonsfather.com/rumors-death-greatly-exaggerated/">he is dead</a> after a scary post about <a href="http://www.mysonsfather.com/high-risk-of-a-heart-attack/">his health</a>. For over a month he was in the state of Schröedinger&#8217;s cat for us but fortunately, it turned out that he is well and alive and got back to the blogging scene with even more energy and professionalism. In the following post, he is&nbsp;tackling an interesting topic. Enjoy.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>My family is very much the embodiment of the American Dream. While we didn’t move here from a poor country, my parents did come from humble beginnings.</p>
<p>They both grew up in poor families and faced a blue-collar future. In fact, when my dad landed an apprenticeship as an electrician, his father was thrilled. A skilled trade was like a golden ticket to a better life.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, it did not go well when my father dropped out of his apprenticeship. My grandfather was livid, believing that my father was throwing his entire future away. Kids from their “status” in life didn’t’ get opportunities like this very often. And to turn your back on it was more than my grandfather could bear.</p>
<p>So, at the age of 17, my father was kicked out of his home. With both my grandfather and my father now deceased, the details of this event remain nebulous. Maybe more folklore than fact, but the outcome is clear.</p>
<h2>Early Adopter</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.mysonsfather.com/lessons-from-death/">My father died</a> long before I first heard the term early adopter, but it fits him perfectly. He loved new technologies. I remember being one of the first families I knew to own a computer. Then one of the first families I knew to have the Internet [insert dial-up sound effect here].</p>
<p><iframe title="Dial Up Sound (HD)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GSRG0TqxLWc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>It was this instinctive love of new technologies that caused my father to leave his apprenticeship as an electrician. Somehow, while growing up in a poor neighborhood in England in the late 1960’s my father got it into his head that technology was the future.</p>
<p>He started working a sales position in a tech firm. A few years after getting married, he was headhunted by a company in the Netherlands. My mom agreed to the move as long as it was temporary. So when my brother was born a couple of years later, they moved back home to England to be closer to the family.</p>
<h2>There is No Looking Back</h2>
<p>Then I came along and they settled into life in their quaint little Oceanside hamlet. Another headhunter and this time an opportunity to move to America. With 2 young kids in tow, my mom was hesitant, but a 2-year agreement was reached.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long before the American spirit won both of my parents over. It truly was the land of opportunity and they both agreed it was the best place to raise their family. So the move became permanent and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-906" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ludlow-1573612_1920-679x1024.jpg" alt="England" width="640" height="965"></p>
<h2>The Land of Opportunity</h2>
<p>Don’t get me wrong; when I say that America is no longer The Land of Opportunity, I’m not saying it isn’t still a land of opportunity. And maybe for many, it is still the best option.</p>
<p>However, my friend HCF is the embodiment of my point. Through the power of this virtual landscape that we call the Internet, he has accessed and then became a part of this amazing personal finance community, all while geographically staying in the same location.</p>
<p>Opportunity is literally floating through the air in the form of Wi-Fi. Knowledge, connections, communities are all waiting at the ready to make your life better. And as HCF demonstrates you don’t have to live in any one place to gain access to these life-changing opportunities.</p>
<h2>Mind Altering</h2>
<p>What my parents fell in love with when they moved to America was not the snow-covered hunk of earth they had moved to. I would argue that the specific location was a downgrade from their Oceanside hometown. No, they fell in love with the American mindset. The sky’s the limit, be what you want to be.</p>
<p>They grew up in a country and in a class that told them their place in the world. They grew up with the belief that their station in life was with the working class, the servant class. Then they moved to America and that distinction appeared to evaporate.</p>
<p>And that is what the Internet provides: a world without distinction.</p>
<p>It doesn’t care where you come from.</p>
<p>It doesn’t care what your background is.</p>
<p>It gives everyone equal access.</p>
<p><strong>Your life can change and the Internet, the Land of Opportunity, can change it.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-908" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/earth-2254769_1920-1024x629.jpg" alt="Internet" width="640" height="393"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>So, the truth is spoken and I just simply cannot agree more. As a guy who grew up in the 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s our upbringing has engraved America into our brains as the Land of Opportunity but I cannot deny that since the Internet opened up its gates for us in the middle of the 90&#8217;s we have seen so many magical things we were never dreaming about before. Huge shout out to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> whose genius turned this world into a better place. Thank you!</em></p>
<p><em>PS: And thank you very much MSF for the kind words, I hope I deserve them.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Let me present you the first guest post on this blog. I follow many blogs (not enough but still more than I should) but only a handful of them rise above the others because of the character, personality and/or writing style of the author.</em></p>
<p><em>This first guest post was written by one of those three bloggers whom I adore because of their interesting writing style and special way of thinking about the things of this crazy world.</em></p>
<p><em>If you still did not find out who is that let me help you a little bit more. He is an ex(?) rebel, an ex-soldier and a man of the law. If that would not be enough to see that he is a real badass I let you know that he is a prepper also, and boy, not a noob in the topic at all. There were some things picking my brain ever since I have read about <a href="https://othalafehu.com/teotwawki/">prepping on his blog</a>, so I reached out to him to share some of his wisdom with us.</em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #ff6600;">If there ever will be a zombie apocalypse I pray to God to have this guy on my side! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></em></p>
<p><em>So, OthalaFehu, my friend the stage is yours.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I get it, not everyone is into being a Prepper.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-845" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prepping_101_1.jpg" alt="Prepping 101 - Lady" width="312" height="400"></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not for everyone, but everyone should be up for a little prepping. My friend over at [HCF] asked me to do a piece on the art/science/and math behind prepping.</p>
<p>I decided to do it on a sliding scale going from basic household all the way to &#8216;that guy in the bunker&#8217;. Prepping is just another form of insurance. You may do all of this for nothing, but if you do need it, it will be the best money you have ever spent.</p>
<p>If you are into FIRE you are financially responsible, prudent, and thinking about the big picture. FIRE is to your finances as PREPPING is to your logistics. It is an organized way to prepare for a chaotic world.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Chance favors the prepared mind.&#8221; &#8211; <span style="color: #ff6600;">Louis Pasteur</span></p></blockquote>
<p>PREPPING can be broken down into the fundamental categories of needs during an emergency, especially an emergency that is not over quickly. Food, Water, Shelter, First Aid, Security, Light/Power, Communication, and Information.</p>
<p>The time, energy, and money one want to put into prepping can be bottomless. So I have broken down each category into 3 degrees of prep; Basic, Moderate, and Serious. Stay tuned for the Extreme, and the &#8216;<span style="color: #ff6600;">All the way down the rabbit hole</span>&#8216; parts, if there is enough interest <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><b>Let&#8217;s start with <span style="color: #ff6600;"><i>Water</i></span>.</b></p>
<p>You can only go 3 days without water before you are done for and clean water may be a problem during an emergency.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prepping_101_2.jpg" alt="Prepping 101 - WaterBob" width="480" height="360"></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Basic</span> &#8211; Buy a <a href="https://waterbob.com/">WaterBob</a> &#8211; This product can be had for $30.00. It is essentially a big plastic bag that is roughly tub-shaped, you put it in your tub, fill it up and presto 100 gallons of water good for at least 16 weeks. Also a gallon of bleach. A tablespoon of bleach per gallon to make the water safe to drink.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Moderate</span> &#8211; Buy a blue barrel. There are food grade 55-gallon barrels complete with lid, spout, and bung wrench to open. All in about $80.00. A little sturdier and a little more permanent. For sterilizing, buy some iodine tablets($5-10).</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Serious</span> &#8211; At this level, you probably have a rain catch system on your house that constantly collects rainwater in outside barrels. You probably also have a fairly industrial filter for making questionable water potable, costs are adding up.</p>
<p><b>Next up is <span style="color: #ff6600;"><i>Food</i></span>.</b></p>
<p>The good news is that you need to store this anyway, so you just have to nip and tuck your current status.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Basic</span> &#8211; Here is a short list of food stuffs you can buy that never go bad, ever; Honey, Rice(just not brown rice), White Vinegar, Vanilla extract, Salt, Cornstarch, Sugar, Dried Beans, Maple Syrup, and Hard Liquor. No reason not to have them, just in case.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-847" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prepping_101_3.jpg" alt="Prepping 101 - Food" width="199" height="300"></p>
<p>You can always buy basic foods, like canned foods, in larger quantities. Just keep in mind to rotate them so that they are not outliving their welcome. You will eventually eat all of those green beans.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Moderate</span> &#8211; Next up is the stuff you don&#8217;t exactly put out for guests. By this, I mean freeze-dried foods and MRE (Meal Ready to Eat). Moderate cost, long shelf life 10-25 years depending on the type. Great for camping and a sense of ease late at night trying to go to bed after watching the news, yikes. The emergency food market has really taken off in recent years and the food is not that bad.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Serious</span> &#8211; Mason jars and the art of canning your own food. Gardening as a hobby for serenity and fresh produce. A brief foray into the world of chicken husbandry.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #ff6600;"><i>Shelter</i></span> comes next.</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Basic</span> &#8211; Your house is your castle. No reason to not make sure the castle is stocked. A days worth of snacks/water/emergency supplies in the trunk of your car never hurt either. Go buy a tent($40), a large basic tarp, and a good length of rope to keep in the garage for the outdoors.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Moderate</span> &#8211; I could rewrite the HOW &amp; WHY of a panic room in your house, but I already did, <a href="http://othalafehu.com/why-do-you-have-a-panic-room/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read about it here</span></a>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Serious</span> &#8211; When you reach this stage, you are talking about a secondary location that is not your house. A Bug Out location. That hunting cabin maybe, or somebody else&#8217;s place that you are on good terms with. There should be a Plan B before there is ever a need for a Plan B.</p>
<p><b>A strong <span style="color: #ff6600;"><i>Defense</i></span> equals security.</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Basic</span> &#8211; 2 firearms, even if you never intend to use them. A shotgun for home defense($250-400). Pump action Mossberg 500 or Remington 870 are the most popular. Second is a .22 caliber rifle for small game/all-purpose($150-250). You can buy ammo for this gun very cheap.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-848" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prepping_101_4.jpg" alt="Prepping 101 - Weapons" width="900" height="483"></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Moderate</span> &#8211; There is a reason you hear so much about the AR-15. It packs a punch and is user-friendly. A more serious gun that will run you around $800. Remember that a gun without ammo is an expensive club. I would say buy 1,000 rounds (.223)</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Serious</span> &#8211; Different guns serve different functions. There are an almost endless variety of firearms for different occasions. If you are thinking this far, you are likely well versed in the topic.</p>
<p><b>Being prepared for an Emergency may very well have to involve <span style="color: #ff6600;"><i>Medical emergencies</i></span>.</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Basic</span> &#8211; A good solid First Aid kit.($20-30) But remember to take the time to look through it. If you do not know how to use something it will not do you much good when the time to open the first aid kit comes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-849" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prepping_101_5.jpg" alt="Prepping 101 - First Aid Kit" width="300" height="300"></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Moderate</span> &#8211; I remember my mother&#8217;s hall closet when I was young. It had stuff in there I didn&#8217;t even know what it did. Leftover bandages and prescriptions from ailments past. This buildup over time translates to a fairly thorough medical supply closet.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Serious</span> &#8211; There are 2 ways to get more serious about medical supplies, quantity, and quality. Different sizes and storing in bulk on one hand. Specialized equipment for the more rare medical emergencies on the other hand. Nothing is a waste if you ever need it. If you don&#8217;t have your health, you don&#8217;t have anything right?</p>
<p><b>I put <span style="color: #ff6600;"><i>Light &amp; Power</i></span> together in the same category.</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Basic</span> &#8211; No-brainer here, a goodly supply of candles, flashlights, and batteries.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-850" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prepping_101_6.jpg" alt="Prepping 101 - Generator" width="225" height="225"></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Moderate</span> &#8211; A lantern if you didn&#8217;t already add one as part of the Basic step. But now is the time to consider a generator. Power outages are the one &#8216;disaster&#8217; scenario we are all universally familiar with. A portable generator can run hundreds of dollars, but if it saved the food in the fridge one time, it has paid for itself. Just remember to never run the generator inside!</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Serious</span> &#8211; Looking into solar power is a big startup cost, but it takes power outages out of the equation. I have only a limited solar setup, but between that and my whole house generator and my &#8216;lots of candles&#8217;, I am in good shape.</p>
<p><b>Almost done folks, only 2 more categories left.</b></p>
<p><b><span style="color: #ff6600;"><i>Communications</i></span> during an emergency.</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Basic</span> &#8211; Do you have a crank charger for your cell phone? If you have a landline, do you keep at least one old-timey phone (i.e. not wireless)? There are also good, cheap, crank handheld radio so you can at least get the news($20).</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Moderate</span> &#8211; two-way handhelds(even kid walkie-talkies will work) are a great way to stay in contact with someone out of sightline during an emergency($15-30).</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Serious</span> &#8211; The world of HAM radio(amateur radio) is kind of fun if you are willing to put the time and infrastructure into it. The cost can run into the hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p><b>Lastly, <span style="color: #ff6600;"><i>knowledge is power</i></span>.</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Basic</span> &#8211; Bored at work, there is a whole internet out there with people in it who love prepping and have put a wealth of information about our hobby out there for free for anyone with the time to read about it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prepping_101_7.jpg" alt="Prepping 101 - Country Living" width="227" height="300"></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Moderate</span> &#8211; Buy a book like The Encyclopedia of Country Living($22), it is an amazing read, especially for us city folk. I also think there is a lot of good fiction that also helps map out what prepping is for, a book like &#8216;Dies the Fire&#8217; by S.M. Stirling.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Serious</span> &#8211; You can build an entire library of this kind of stuff. Everything from &#8216;How Things Work&#8217;, to Homesteading, to Animal Husbandry, to Bushcraft, to Surviving Nuclear War. Etc.Etc.Etc&#8230;Happy Hunting. Oh yeah, and books on Hunting too.</p>
<p><em>Now you have it. All the basics you need to kick off your &#8220;prepping career&#8221;. Some of these principles were not new to me. It is interesting that when you live in a <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/three-financial-lessons/">place where incidents, emergencies, and even wars</a> were not unknown how this &#8220;life hacks&#8221; stay ingrained into the everyday lives of the people. Having food in bulk, first aid kits, candles, and flashlights is obvious, but you can find generators also in almost every household. At some parts, the situation is same with weapons (not in my family).</em></p>
<p><em>Also, there were some ideas which are simple still I have never heard of, like that WaterBob thing, bleach and iodine tablets for water. It seems I need some improvements on my preparation levels. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>
<p><em>Hope you enjoyed this post as much as I did and don&#8217;t shy away from asking anything from OthalaFehu int the comments if you remained curious <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/call-the-man-or-be-the-man/">revealed some details</a> about our current landscaping and &#8220;relawning&#8221; project. We made good progress so we thought we can have a day of rest and having fun. Some friends came over and we had a grill party. Recently, I acquired two bottles of homemade <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakia">Rakia</a>&nbsp;(a spirit, which is very popular in my country) so we went on with some tasting. Long story short, we had a good time, but unfortunately, I lost my sanity and the night closed with blackout&#8230; I am not proud of it and this is not something I am doing often.</p>
<p><iframe title="ALESTORM - Hangover (Taio Cruz Cover) | Napalm Records" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d5P5Tz3VH94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The next day I woke up with a horrible hangover. Was facing some hardships going through the daily routine, but we are responsible adults, after all, right? We have our duties which do not really care about our stupid decisions. So we have to suck it up and do whatever we have to do. Then when I was brainstorming for this post today after reading the latest post over at <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2018/04/10/hacking-hedonic-adaptation/">Mr.MoneyMustache.com</a> and was facing with this phrase I realized that the process to get over a financial hangover and a traditional one is pretty similar. Let&#8217;s see what are the steps.</p>
<h2>Facing the problem</h2>
<p>You are opening your eyes and realizing that you did something really stupid. You drank/spent more than you should have and despite the fact that at that moment it seemed a good idea now you can clearly feel that you made a huge mistake. You can feel the pain in your head and stomach/wallet or bank account. You know you are in trouble. Maybe your significant other is standing next to you reminding that she/he told you that it is not a good idea. You admit it that she/he is right, but still, that does not help on your condition. So, now that you realized what happened to you let&#8217;s get to the next step.</p>
<h2>Assess the damage</h2>
<p>Now you feel bad. The next thing is to start collecting information about the situation. You start off by examining the scene then questioning your fellow humans around you. Lastly, you turn to the internet. What did you mess up? How bad the situation really is? What would have been the right choice? Ok, this latter maybe does not help a lot but can bring you to the next step.</p>
<h2>Quick fix what you can</h2>
<p>In that case, if our previous investigation revealed some options that we can act on immediately we should go for it. Even if your stomach has a different opinion you should drink a couple of glasses of water alongside with a painkiller. Check your accounts and find out if you have any leftover money which you can throw into the face of the monster you unlocked. Do whatever it requires cleaning your head as much as possible.</p>
<h2>Create a plan</h2>
<p>When you are done applying the patches it is the time to step back and try to focus on the bigger picture. How will the recent events affect the near&nbsp;future? And what about the long-term? It is research time again. You&nbsp;have generated some problems, but that does not mean that you cannot ask for help. Just don&#8217;t be demanding or aggressive, you were the one who got yourself into trouble after all. Do your&nbsp;research and sketch up a plan for resolving the issues.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-825" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/light-1024x579.jpg" alt="Light" width="640" height="362"></p>
<h2>Suck it up and stick to it</h2>
<p>Now that we have a killer plan in hand (or maybe a dirty piece of paper with almost uninterpretable handwriting) we know what we can expect from the future. Maybe we are scared, disappointed or distressed. Maybe all of these and more. We have to face it: it will be tough. But the more you are thinking about it you start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Suddenly a scene pops into your mind. A woman is whispering in your ear.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>This&nbsp;will not&nbsp;be&nbsp;over quickly. You&nbsp;will not&nbsp;enjoy this.</em>&#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>You start smiling.</p>
<h2>Support the healing process</h2>
<p>With your plan in hand and confidence in your ability to fix the mistakes, the healing process can begin. The path will be rough. You will need your desperation and will, but you feel that you can manage it. There&#8217;s a chance sometime nausea will strike. Maybe even you can discover signs of depression. But remind yourself that these are just symptoms of a problem what is temporary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The past two weeks were extremely busy in the [HCF] household and we are still looking forward a lot more to come. Maybe some of you noticed that I was AFK since Good Friday. Living in a country like Serbia while belonging to the largest minority group has its advantages and disadvantages. I was experiencing the former lately in the form of unexpected holidays.</p>
<p>The vast majority of citizens are Eastern Orthodox Christians (<b>~</b>85%), and the second one are Catholics (<b>~</b>5%, I am part of that group). The only relevance here is that while the former follows the Julian calendar, the latter follows the Gregorian. This causes a difference in the dates of their celebrations. Orthodox Good Friday and Easter Monday are public holidays in Serbia and they also respect the Catholic celebrations too, so we got four days off altogether.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I jumped on the opportunity to take off the three in between workdays prolonging my holiday to eleven days. How could anyone use that much of &#8220;free&#8221; time? (Put into quotation marks because if you have kids I think you don&#8217;t really have free time <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) Pack your&nbsp;backpacks and head to a tropical island? Would be good, but it is officially Spring now. Which besides good weather and awakening nature means a lot of work around the house.</p>
<p>When we bought our current home three years ago I thought that the size of our garden is reasonable (despite the wise warnings of my wife). It is roughly only one-third of an acre after all. Pice of cake. And don&#8217;t bother that the soil consists of sand 99%. Should not be a problem, right? Well, it turned out that making the land thrive only with manual labor is a hard thing. Also that the sandy soil is really not a&nbsp;problem. Unless you want to have a green lawn and a verdurous garden. In that case, you have to invest a significant amount of time and money.</p>
<p>Basically, you have two choices for every task. To call the man or to be the man. I mentioned in my <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/three-simple-productivity-booster-tricks/">earlier post</a> that I successfully acquired a healthy DIY mentality in the latest years, but sometimes that is not enough. Through these three years, I bought the most often used tools: drills, wrenches, screwdrivers, hammers, clamps, etc. but still postponed bigger purchases like a garden rotavator.</p>
<h2>The lawn</h2>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into the details (mainly because I don&#8217;t want to present my incompetence), but let&#8217;s say that for some reason we have to resow the lawn. In the previous years I borrowed a rotavator for such occasions, but this year that was not an option and sadly there are no shops where you can rent one (no idea why). So, I called the man.</p>
<p>The man showed up on time at the day we agreed. He was a kind, smiling, grandpa type guy close to his seventies. This is not a strange thing over here. I don&#8217;t really know a lot of folks who are happily retired and living in abundance in their golden years. Most of them are working until they can or are living extremely frugal lifestyles. This man was a farmer all his life, still having some orchards and to earn a little side income in addition to his small pension he takes on this kind of gigs.</p>
<p>After that initial conversation, he started to work. Maneuvered with big routine between the trees with his small tractor and finished the whole garden in an hour. We agreed that he will repeat it once more two days later. That time he arrived half an hour early and the whole process took only 45 mins. When he finished I shelled out the $75 we agreed on, shake hands and he left.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-804" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/common-daisy-3304420_1920-e1523484236443.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333"></p>
<p><em><strong>The result</strong>: I am kind of satisfied. The other option would have been to buy a manual rotavator for $300-$500 and do it myself. That option would be more expensive and would take more time but maybe the end result would have been better. The former solution was the faster so I am ok with it, just next time will consider the latter. Still, we are facing a lot of work until we can watch the grass grow.</em></p>
<h2>The fence</h2>
<p>At the back of our&nbsp;plot, there is an old fence which seemingly could collapse at any moment. The neighbor is an old guy whom I only saw two times since we live here. The former owner said that he has some health issues and not really able to do any physical work, so I planned rebuilding it for a while. Bought the cement pillars and the wire mesh previous year just did not manage to put it together. Also was afraid of messing it up as I have never built a fence myself. So, I called the man.</p>
<p>This time the man was my father. He kindly accepted my cry for help and jumped into his <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/how-i-fell-in-love-with-hatchbacks/">good </a>ol&#8217; 101 on the first day when his business let him leave early. In the end, we did not remove the old fence, just put the new one next to it on our side. The whole process took almost a day, despite the length is only around 32 feet. My soft coder hands were aching by the end of the day, but I was taught how to install a pillar properly, how to attach the mesh to it while the whole thing looks good and standing solid.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-805" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fence-3215628_1920-e1523484276529.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333"></p>
<p><em><strong>The result</strong>: maximum satisfaction! Maybe I am biased but I think a professional fence builder would not make it any better and I only had to buy the materials, approximately $50 altogether.&nbsp;Thanks, Dad <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>
<h2>The rest</h2>
<p>Maybe this does not sound a lot of work for you, but it is for me after the lazy winter times. In this timespan, we also cleaned out our basement, planted some trees, removed others, finished weeding the flower garden, assembled the trampoline (the happiest part for our four-year-old daughter <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).</p>
<p>Still, there is a lot to do. First of all, we have to smooth the sand, sow the new grass, add some fertilizer then cover with some better soil. This will take significant time alone. At some parts of the garden, I plan to install some sprinklers. Promised my wife that this year we will finish building a rockery also.</p>
<p>Oh, and almost forgot about the vegetable garden. Unfortunately, my chili seedlings died a horrific death because of exposing them to sun and chilly weather too early (yeah, I am looking at you, Honey) so I will have to buy some from local farmers alongside with tomato and pepper seedlings, however, I will give a shot to sowing some directly outside. We will see.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-806" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/flower-1316906_1920-e1523484308931.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When you are overwhelmed by the tasks and you do not possess all the necessary abilities/tools/resources, don&#8217;t afraid of outsourcing or asking for help. DIY mentality is an important thing to have but remember that Rome was not built in a day and especially not by the hands of a single man.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you follow my&nbsp;blog you may have noticed that I have &#8220;slight&#8221; productivity problems. So with or without intention, I try to pick up positive habits which help me get better at it.</p>
<p>The following three is from the ones which I definitely didn&#8217;t establish by will. I get to them by observation. When noticed that a specific event/thought made a positive change in my behavior to the extent which surprised&nbsp;me I tried to engrave it in my mind. Then when I was in similar situations recalled them and enjoyed the effect. Maybe it sounds crazy, but trust me I am normal, the voices told me. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So here are my top three productivity tricks which you can use too. Enjoy them.</p>
<h2>The nagging voices of Mr. Money Mustache</h2>
<p>Hey, I warned you that it will sound crazy and/or stupid <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Yeah, it&#8217;s true. I was pulled into this PF sect by Pete&#8217;s blog, which similar to many others I read from cover to cover and had a helluva fun. Then checked a couple of interviews with him also. Then a strange thing happened to me.</p>
<p>It was on a Monday&nbsp;morning. I drowsily arrived to&nbsp;work one hour earlier than usual. Entered the building and pushed the&nbsp;button on the elevator. That was the first time I heard &#8220;The Voice&#8221;. His voice. He was laughing and jokingly asked if I would like to use a catheter and bedpan on the way up. Needless to say, I felt the shame and chose the stairs. It is just five levels after all.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-782" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/elevator_overly_manly_man.jpg" alt="Overly Manly Man on elevators" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>Then it happened the next morning. And the following one. Then I heard it in the morning when I prepared for leaving to work and was thinking about my options to get there. These happened last spring. Long story short, since then I bike, walk or carpool to work, use the elevator only when it is absolutely necessary and if there is a task which I could handle myself I do it most of the times.</p>
<p>Try it out next time when you do something you know you should not. He could be very persuasive. Thank you, MMM,&nbsp;for this <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>Move with the flow</h2>
<p>I could be, but no, I am not talking about the miraculous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a> state introduced by the famous Hungarian psychologist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a>&nbsp;(hey, we Hungarians are everywhere). It is much more simple and maybe even an obvious one. I talk about music.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dub FX &#039;Flow&#039; feat. Mr Woodnote" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhBoR_tgXCI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>We know that it is scientifically proved that a persons heart rate adjusts to the rhythm of the music he/she is listening to. I assume this has an effect on our overall performance. I noticed at work when I am listening to music with characteristic singing voice and fast rhythm my brain is able to think more rapidly and I become more productive in my tasks.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all, no rocket science here. I consume a huge variety of music, oftentimes from totally different genres. I don&#8217;t want to scare you away so will not list my favorite bands. You can get a hint about my preferences from my <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/pirates-of-the-cryptobbean/">Pirates of the Cryptobbean</a>&nbsp;article or from the tears which this epic <a href="https://www.idreamoffire.com/10-punk-rock-songs-frugal-badass/">post from I&nbsp;Dream Of Fire</a> brought to my eyes.</p>
<p>To make it easier to use this trick I would add one track which often kickoffs my mornings and could be the hymn of the whole FIRE community. Thanks for the inspiration, Lzzy!</p>
<p><iframe title="Halestorm - &quot;I Am The Fire&quot; [Official Video]" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8hkmuTvkp_s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>The most peaceful place on earth</h2>
<p>This is the oldest of the three. I discovered this in my teenage years while reading one of the awesome novels from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istv%C3%A1n_Fekete">István Fekete</a>(Steve Black :)) called Derengő Hajnal(Day Breaking). There was a description of a room in a house in a small village. Far away from the noise of the cities, without cars or other distracting sounds, there was that quiet peaceful room. In a house which walls were built from earth. The floor was of rammed earth too. If you have ever been in a room like that you know that there is a special comforting smell in there. The rest of the description of the room is hazy but imagine very minimalistic furnishing. It is day breaking, everyone is asleep in the house, and probably in the village too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-780 size-large" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/peaceful_room-1024x682.jpg" alt="Peaceful room" width="640" height="426"></p>
<p>I felt back then and even today that place could be the most peaceful place on earth. When I struggle, am stressed, worried or just simply tired I close my eyes and imagine myself lying on the bed in this room. Nothing can disturb me and I just enjoy the perfect and complete silence. Spending a couple of minutes like that puts me at total ease. Or into sleep <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for today. Hope you found it interesting. If you use some of these or got tempted to try out please let me know in the comments, I really want to hear about how do these working for others.</p>
