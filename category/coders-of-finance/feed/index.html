Enjoy!</p>
<h3>Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p>Hello. I’m a blogger who primarily blogs about personal finance. My website is Freedom Is Groovy. My wife and I started the blog in August of 2015 and we go by the monikers Mrs. Groovy and Mr. Groovy, respectively. We haven’t revealed our true identities in order to maintain a bit of privacy.</p>
<h3>Tell us a nerdy secret if you have one</h3>
<p>I’m 57 years old and I’m still intrigued by math. I have a Khan Academy login and I try to do one or two math problems a day. If Mrs.G. would let me, I’d like to take our country’s leading standardized test for college admission again, the SAT.</p>
<h3>When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p>I was in college in the early 80s and my housemate was an engineering student who actually had a personal computer (very rare back then). I don’t know exactly what he did with his PC. It and the software that came with it was very crude. All I know is that he would use his PC to connect to our school’s engineering department over the phone line and our house phone would be out of commission for hours.</p>
<h3>What was your first machine?</h3>
<p>My first PC an Epson (yes, the company primarily known for printers used to make PCs). I bought it in 1986 or 1987, and the hard drive was only 20 megabytes. I couldn’t afford the 40-megabyte hard drive model. Oh, and I bought my first PC because I wanted to write a book.</p>
<h3>Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p>I jumped straight into programming. I worked in a highway department and all the roads we maintained were cataloged in a Word document (we called it the “street dictionary”). Anyway, for a number of reasons I won’t detail here, cataloging our roads in a Word document wasn’t very practical. So I took it upon myself to manual type all the information from our street dictionary into an Access database. Learning Access databases led me to VBA and SQL, and VBA and SQL let me to C++.</p>
<h3>What about education, was it related to computing, did you learn in a traditional way or something else?</h3>
<p>I studied sociology, journalism, and public administration&#8211;nothing related to computers and programming. I got the database and programming bug in the mid-90s and I’m entirely self-taught. Back then I would just buy one database or programming book at a time and just plow through it.</p>
<h3>What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p>I have a BA in sociology, a BS in journalism, and an MPA in public administration.</p>
<h3>When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</h3>
<p>I got my first real job in 1986. As already mentioned before, it was with a highway department on Long Island, New York. I started off as a clerk in the personnel department and eventually got promoted to a construction inspector after passing a civil service exam. About three years into my construction inspector career, I was put in charge of rating all the roads we maintained. Part of this new assignment also meant maintaining the street dictionary I mentioned earlier, and the street dictionary proved to be the impetus of my IT career.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I was the highway department’s IT for over ten years but my titled never changed from a construction inspector. My highway department didn’t have any computer or programming related job titles at the time.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Groovy and I left Long Island in 2006 and relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina, I got my first IT job with an actual IT title. I was a data analyst for a healthcare consultant and I mainly did what I did for the highway department&#8211;create and manage databases and write code.</p>
<h3>What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p>I only worked formally in the IT sector for ten years. And I only worked for one company during that ten year period. And what pleasantly surprised me about this company was that it wasn’t a slave to formal credentials. Most of the IT people in this company had computer science degrees. But at least a third didn’t. All this company cared about were skills. If you had the skills, you would be hired and promoted. It didn’t matter whether you learned those skills in college or on your own. And just for the record, there were four guys at this company that I really looked up to. Their programming skills were off the charts. Two had computer science degrees and two were self-taught.</p>
<h3>What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</h3>
<p>I am currently retired. Mrs. Groovy and I achieved financial independence in 2014 but didn’t retire until October of 2016. We wanted to make sure we entered retirement with a nice cushion.</p>
<h3>Tell us about your journey so far?</h3>
<p>For Mrs. Groovy and me, the key to achieving financial independence was getting out of debt and owning our home outright. Once you have shed the mortgage, the car loan, and the credit card debt, the cost of living is remarkably cheap, especially in the southern portion of the United States. When we became completely debt free and owned our home outright in 2006, we were able to save over half of our gross household income. Save over half of your gross household income for ten years and you’ll have a good chance of achieving financial independence&#8211;providing the stock market doesn’t frown on you, of course. Another key was finding contentment in the ordinary. If you need fancy cars, clothes, electronics, and vacations to secure happiness, you’ll have a very difficult time-saving money and achieving financial independence. Don&#8217;t’ get me wrong. Mrs. Groovy and I appreciate fabulous stuff just like everyone else. In fact, we’re spending five weeks in Australia later this year. But we get just as much joy out of playing cards with family and friends or going out for ice cream on a Saturday night, or reading a good book. Master the art of being happy with less and life will get incredibly easy.</p>
<h3>How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</h3>
<p>Being an IT guy primarily affected my finances by making me a coveted employee. Once I developed top-notch database skills, I had no problem securing employment, promotions, and bonuses. For instance, at my last job, I started off as a data analyst. Then I was promoted to program specialist, and soon after that, I was promoted to program manager. And all because I had a knack for manipulating data, automating tasks, and writing complex SQL.</p>
<h3>Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p>Yes. And it doesn’t take much to see if you have an aptitude for IT field. If you’re a cubicle jockey who primarily answers phone calls and performs data entry, start teaching yourself Excel and Access. And after three months or so of learning the basics of spreadsheets and databases, start trying to automate aspects of your job with Excel, Access, and VBA. It’s a great way to learn something on your boss’s dime and make your job easier. Also, it’s a great way to advance your career. Become good at automating routine office tasks and you will become a very valuable employee.</p>
<h3>Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p>Hell no! My biggest regret is that I didn’t discover databases and programming sooner.</p>
<h3>Tips for beginners?</h3>
<p>Start. Download Notepad++ and start coding with Javascript. Go to the W3School and the Khan Academy and start working through the Javascript tutorials. Once you get comfortable with Javascript, move on to PHP or Python. Finally, you should become familiar with databases and SQL. Backend databases hold the world’s data and once you can communicate with databases via SQL, you have all the world’s data at your fingertips. Very powerful. Download the latest express edition of SQL Server from Microsoft and start honing your SQL skills (the express version is free).</p>
<h3>Which technology area picks your brain most these days?</h3>
<p>I’m out of the IT business these days. I mainly occupy my brain by reading and writing about personal finance. Before I left the workforce in 2016, I was very intrigued by No SQL databases. No SQL databases store data in free-flowing tables. One row might have ten columns and the next row might have twenty columns. Apparently, this kind of storage works better with massive amounts of data than regular SQL databases. You can retrieve your data faster. Anyway, during the last year or so of my career, I started playing around with Mongo, an opensource No SQL database. So if I were still in the IT game today, I would be honing my No SQL skills.</p>
<h3>What do you think is the biggest improvement/challenge the IT industry looking forward these days?</h3>
<p>Today, it’s much easier to teach yourself and prove to potential employers that you have the requisite skills. And you don’t have to be rich to go the DIY route. When I got interested in databases and coding in the 90s, there was no opensource software, no YouTube, no Khan Academy, no GitHub, no high-speed internet, and no blogosphere. I imagine there were some certifications back then, but I don’t recall any. If people wanted to get a worthwhile IT credential, they had to go to college.</p>
<h3>We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</h3>
<p>• Desktop OS: Windows 10<br />
• Mobile OS: Android<br />
• Machine: HP<br />
• Browser: Chrome<br />
• Programming language: SQL (I know. Not really a language, but I’m an SQL junkie.)<br />
• And the most important… spaces or tabs: Tabs</p>
<h3>Would you write a couple of lines of code to present a simple financial principle?</h3>
<pre>Dim curMonthlyExpenses as currency
Dim curMonthlyTakeHomePay as currency
Dim sSQL as string

curMonthlyTakeHomePay = $6000

sSQL = “Select Sum(Amount) From ExpenseLogTable Where Month(ExpenseDate) = 4;”

curMonthlyExpenses = GetMonthlyExpenses(sSQL)

If curMonthlyTakeHomePay - curMonthlyExpenses &gt; 0
    DepositMoneyIntoBrokerageAccount(curMonthlyTakeHomePay - curMonthlyExpenses)
Else
    MsgBox (“You’re spending too much!”)</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, groovy freedomist, that’s all I got. What say you? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><em>(Sorry, but cannot resist stealing your finishing line)</em></p>

I just realized browsing the previous episodes that despite we are all coders how different our paths, visions, mindsets, and skillsets are. Marc just raises this diversity further. His way of running his business is truly inspiring and his achievements aren&#8217;t small wins in my opinion. So, Marc please take it over.</em></p>
<h3>Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Marc. I’m 40 years old and I live in Pennsylvania with my wife and our two kids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My experience is different than most of the other people who have been interviewed in this series. I have some experience with web design and development, but most of my experience is related to online business. I got started with web design, but that led to me creating my own websites and blogs. I’ve been managing my own sites/blogs full-time since 2008.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I think of myself as an online entrepreneur first, an interest in web design was really what started it all. I used to design and code custom WordPress themes and websites for small businesses, both for clients and to create and maintain my own websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ran a web design blog from 2007 &#8211; 2013 (more on that in a minute) so I worked in the industry even though I wasn’t taking that many client projects for most of those years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the web design blog, I’ve also had blogs on photography, travel, and now finance. </span><a href="https://vitaldollar.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VitalDollar.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a personal finance blog, is my current project.</span></p>
<h3><b>Tell us a nerdy secret if you have one</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think my secret is that I don’t have a whole lot in common with most developers. My background is in business and what really attracted me to web design and development was the possibility of being able to create my own websites in order to make money. I saw the entrepreneurial side of it, and that led me to an interest in learning how to code.</span></p>
<h3><b>When was your first encounter with computing?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My parents had a desktop computer when I was pretty young (I guess it was in the mid-80’s). I used it to play games. I had a baseball game that I loved to play, and there was also some horse racing game that was a lot of fun betting on fake horses. I remember the graphics were terrible. It looked like little chairs moving, nothing like horses. Looking back, I guess I’m kind of fortunate that I didn’t develop a gambling addiction. </span></p>
<h3><b>What about education, was it related to computing, did you learn in a traditional way or something else? What kind of degree do you have?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My degree is in Business Administration, but in my last semester I took an elective course on web design and I really loved it. The course was very basic HTML and some graphics. By the end of the course, we were able to create a basic table-based website (this was back in 2002).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That course really got me interested, and since I was majoring in business I saw the potential in being able to code my own websites as business experiments. After college, I continued to learn on my own by reading books and following online tutorials. I had to learn CSS because the course didn’t cover that at all. I played around creating some websites of my own just to learn, although I don’t think any of those websites went live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2006, I started doing some web design for friends and family that had small businesses. I enjoyed it and I needed some extra money, so in 2007 I decided to try to expand and find clients from outside of my personal network. I set up a portfolio website and a blog to try to attract traffic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That blog took off really quickly. It did help me to land some clients, but I realized I didn’t really like the client work, and I actually liked working on my own blog more. I decided to shift my focus, and from then on my blog content targeted other web designers, rather than potential clients for my services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the target audience of my blog was other designers, I did get a decent number of potential clients contacting me through the site. I didn’t take on a lot of client work, but if there was a project that looked like a good fit, I would pursue it. It was mostly websites for small businesses and non-profit organizations, including a few churches. Most of them were custom WordPress themes, but I did do a few static HTML websites for clients, and I worked with a few other content management systems, like LightCMS.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1347" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/workstation-405768_1920.jpg" alt="Workstation" width="1920" height="1294"></p>
<h3><b>When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I graduated from college in 2002, and I worked in a few different jobs in the finance industry from 2002 &#8211; 2008. Although I always had work, I struggled to find a job that I liked. I wanted something that would give me a chance to grow and develop, but everything just seemed like a dead end job. That’s really what led me to start my web design and blogging side hustle in 2007.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2008, about 1.5 years after starting my blog, I was able to leave my job and pursue my own business full-time. At that point I was making some advertising revenue from my blog, doing some freelance writing for other web design blogs, and a small amount of client work for web design and website maintenance.</span></p>
<h3><b>What are your experiences about the industry?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve never worked as an employee in the industry. I did some freelance work for a few years, and I’ve also managed my own websites and blogs since 2007. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a web design blog, of course, I had plenty of contact with other web designers and developers. I always enjoyed getting to know other people in the industry, and I found designers and developers to be very welcoming.</span></p>
<h3><b>Are you still coding?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not really. The extent of my coding now is limited to some small customizations to the styling of WordPress themes, or maybe some opt-in forms. I always coded my own sites up until about 2014. Running my own sites kept me busy enough that I didn’t have time to really get practice and stay up-to-date with trends when mobile browsing became a lot more popular. Another factor was that premium WordPress themes were getting easier to customize, so for the past few years, it has made more sense for me to use available themes rather coding from scratch. When I started coding responsive themes it was taking me too long. With plenty of WordPress themes available, it just seemed unnecessary to do it myself.</span></p>
<h3><b>How has the ability to code impacted your business?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My business started when I was doing freelance web design work, so it never would have started without coding. My interest in design and development allowed me to grow a successful blog that gave me a great start to my career and had a big impact on my family’s finances.</span></p>
<h3><b>What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I are hoping to be able to retire early, but not exceptionally early. She has been a stay-at-home mom since our daughter was born in 2012. We hope that she’ll be able to work with me in a few years once our son starts school (our daughter is in kindergarten this year).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to be able to retire by the time our youngest graduates from high school, which should be about 15 years from now. I would be about 55, and my wife would be about 53. We’re on track to reach those goals, but in the world of self-employment, you really never know what might happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t view financial independence quite the same as some other people in the FI community. I don’t think 25x our annual expenses is enough for either my wife or I to feel freedom over money. To me, the whole point of financial freedom is the actual feeling and relief of not needing to worry about money. Our goal is to have 50x our current annual expenses, which I should allow both us to truly feel that freedom. Right now we’re about halfway there.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1348" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/keyboard-338505_1920.jpg" alt="Camera" width="1920" height="1271"></p>
<h3><b>Tell us about your journey so far?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My 20’s were pretty much a waste financially. Like I mentioned earlier, I wasn’t able to find a job that I liked, and my income was on the lower side all the way through my 20’s. I started my web design and blogging side hustle when I was 28 and left my full-time job right when I turned 30. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, my 30’s were much more productive years. I was able to have some success with the web design blog that originally started as a side hustle. I managed that blog for several years before I sold it in 2013 for $500,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, I had a few different photography blogs that I started. I’ve sold those blogs now (you can read on my blog about </span><a href="https://vitaldollar.com/how-to-make-money-from-hobby/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how I turned a photography hobby into more than $1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), but they were a lot of fun to manage for a few years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I’m focusing on growing Vital Dollar, although I also have a few small </span><a href="https://vitaldollar.com/build-a-niche-website/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">niche websites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><b>How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think my profession has significantly impacted my finances. When I started my own business our financial situation wasn’t that great. We weren’t in debt, aside from a mortgage, but we were saving enough money to reach our goals. We managed our money pretty well, but our income wasn’t high enough to allow us to meet aggressive goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I started my own business, my income has been significantly higher. My wife was able to leave her job, which never would have been possible on my old income. We’ve also been able to grow our net worth, </span><a href="https://vitaldollar.com/realities-of-mortgage-free-living/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay off our mortgage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and give ourselves a shot at reaching our early retirement goals.</span></p>
<h3><b>Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would definitely recommend an online business for anyone who is interested, and willing to put in the work. It wasn’t easy and took some sacrifices early on, but it has paid off. I love being able to work from home and choose the projects that I work on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the coders out there, personal projects and side hustles are a great way to get started with entrepreneurship.</span></p>
<h3><b>We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Desktop OS &#8211; Mostly PC, but I also have a Mac. I don’t really have a preference, I just have more experience with PC and they’re cheaper, so that’s what I typically use. On my photography blogs I sold some downloadable products that were basically software add-ons, so I have both so I could test my products.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mobile OS &#8211; Android. I’ve never used anything else.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Browser &#8211; Mostly Chrome, but I also use Firefox. There are a few Chrome extensions that I use a lot, so that’s the main reason I stay mostly in Chrome.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Thank you, Marc, that you have shared your journey with us. All of us can learn something from you. Many coders are just dreaming about dedicating themselves to their own projects full-time. Of course, it is not without reason as a huge percentage of startups fail pretty quickly. Playing it safe and starting something on the side is always a good idea and still lets you test the waters.</em></p>
<p><em>What do you think? Which would bring more success to a coder as an entrepreneur, business skills or technical skills, or both on an equal level? Share your thoughts with us in the comments.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><i>Welcome back geeky FIRE seekers. A long time has passed since the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/coders-of-finance-ms-ziyou/">last episode</a> of this series. Some folks even asked me if it is over. The truth is that this series takes place in a special corner of my heart and I don&#8217;t really plan on killing it before I stop blogging, so please calm down.&nbsp;</i>Today I brought you another fellow European and London based blogger who shied away so far from talking about the topic of programming in detail on his blog, however, he is one with the most advanced programming skills amongst us. </em><em>Enjoy!</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Greetings to all my imaginary friends on the internet! I am the man behind the pseudonym { in·deed·a·bly }, who publishes random thoughts at <a href="https://indeedably.com">indeedably.com</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us a nerdy secret if you have one</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I wrote the original real-time SMS vote counting algorithm used by several reality television shows.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some enterprising guys on my team monitored the incoming results, then dashed down to the bookmakers just before voting closed to bet on the outcome.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They didn’t win, learning an expensive lesson that reality television shows are scripted!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I was about 7 years old, my father came home carrying an enormous box containing a computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He plugged it into the television and powered it up, then sat there staring expectantly at the blinking cursor with a puzzled expression on his face… waiting for something to happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It quickly became apparent he had absolutely no idea what to do next!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The following day he bought a copy of a computer magazine called Zap from the local newsagent. It came with an insert containing the code listing for a game called Aztec Challenge.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1220 size-full" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ActecChallenge_Animation.gif" alt="ActecChallenge" width="384" height="272"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This was years before the World Wide Web was a glimmer in Tim Berners-Lee’s eye. Back then if you wanted to play a game, you first had to type in the source code!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My father valiantly tried to key in the pages of incomprehensible hexadecimal source code. He quickly became frustrated, deciding that his sausage fingers weren’t designed for “computering”. He parked me in front of the keyboard and proceeded to dictate the source code, giving me a clip over the ear each time the checksum validator beeped an objection to my dubious two finger typing skills.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fortunately, this too quickly became boring. My father stormed out to the shed to play with toys that he did understand&#8230; power tools! I don’t recall him ever attempting to use that computer again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Labouriously I keyed in the remainder of the source code. It took hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Eventually, it was done, and I was able to run the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was magical! From that moment onwards I was hooked on computers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What was your first machine?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A Commodore 64, with a cassette player and a joystick.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1221 size-full" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Commodore_64_with_the_external_power_supply_and_Commodore_1530_C2N_Datasette.jpg" alt="Commodore 64" width="800" height="401"></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I quickly became more interested in learning how they worked rather than playing them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I wanted to peek behind the curtain at the code that was executing while a program was running.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To translate the magic into science.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To learn how programs actually performed whatever function they were executing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before long I had taught myself to program in BASIC. Soon I was modifying games to make them better. Eventually, I started writing games of my own.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What about education, was it related to computing, did you learn in a traditional way or something else? What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Near the end of high school, the school I attended acquired a dozen battered old IBM XT clones. They announced they would offer a computing course, re-badged themselves a “technology” school, and begged the local government for additional funding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A very angry English teacher was given the thankless task of trying to teach a bunch of disinterested teenagers how to code. He must have really upset the school principal to be given that assignment!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the first lesson, it quickly became apparent the teacher had never before used a computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By the end of the second lesson, the other students were asking me for assistance debugging their simple “Hello World” programs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Halfway through the third lesson, the teacher gave up and tasked me with running the class.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For the remainder of the school year, I taught the class how to code their own “choose your own adventure” style quest game (including graphics and sound).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The teacher contentedly sat in the corner reading novels by Douglas Adams and Grant Naylor, randomly bursting into thunderous belly laughs that shook the windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At university, I studied Accounting. I took a couple of elective computing classes early on but quickly concluded the impractical way universities teach computing wouldn’t help me get a job.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">My first job was delivering newspapers, aged 10.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I took a second job working in a photo lab, aged 16.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I added a third job working in a bar, aged 18.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My first professional job was as an Accountant, aged 20.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Accounting was great. It paid well! More importantly, it taught me to understand the profit motive and how to identify the value chain. These are valuable life skills that everyone should possess.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Accounting also involved no heavy lifting, working outdoors in the rain, breaking up drunken fights, or developing the random (often bizarre, and occasionally disturbing) photos that people take!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Aged 21, I followed a pretty girl to the United Kingdom on a working holiday visa. There I fell into a freelance developer <a href="https://indeedably.com/fear/">contract</a>, and have been involved in IT ever since.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the beginning, I loved the beauty of an elegantly coded algorithm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In those days memory, storage, and CPU cycles were expensive precious commodities. I learned that program efficiency was paramount, and performance tuning was a superpower.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In time I realized that it really didn’t matter how fast or pretty my code was if the specification I was working to failed to solve the client’s business problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I moved upstream, into analysis and requirements capture.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It turned out that clients often ask for the wrong thing. In these cases, regardless of how faithfully my requirements document captured their request, the resulting solution would solve exactly the wrong problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I moved upstream again, into architecture and later management consulting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now I got involved right at the start, helping clients to differentiate between what they think they want and what they actually need.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This typically involves identifying the strategic goals the client hopes to achieve, then (providing the goal makes sense) determining the optimal way to make it happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">More often than, what is required are people and process focussed changes, that no amount of technical wizardry could ever hope to rectify!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also learned that data is the true lifeblood of an organization, far more important than any individual process or piece of code.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lose or leak too much of it, and the business dies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Corrupt it, and the business experiences a long lingering death from badly informed decision making.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Data lasts forever. It will outlive any of the ever-changing array of transient applications, pipelines and data stores through which it may travel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look after your data as if your life depends on it… because in your business’s case, it really does!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am very fortunate, in that I have passed the point of having “enough”.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us about your journey so far?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over the years I have established a diversified set of sustainable <a href="https://indeedably.com/i-own/">passive income streams</a> that now cover the majority of my living expenses.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Several years ago I struck a balance between living for today and planning for tomorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I lead a semi-retired working pattern. During the cold wet London winter months, I usually help clients solve interesting tricky problems. The remainder of the year I enjoy being a man of leisure.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Information Technology provides a wealth of opportunities for those who are willing to take them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">IT remains one of the few remaining professions where there are low barriers to entry, and what you can do matters far more than where you went to school or who you know.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Working initially as a freelancer, and then later running a consultancy, allowed me to dictate the pace of my career progression. I could also charge whatever a client was willing to pay for my time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The flip side of that equation is that every day is a performance evaluation: do well today and you may be welcome back tomorrow. Do poorly and you will quickly find yourself seeking a new client. Competitive pressures and commercial uncertainties are constant threats to your livelihood.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Everyone should learn the basics of coding: algorithm design, control of flow, and decision statements. These are core competencies, similar to having a basic grasp of reading or maths.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, I think people should carefully consider what they desire from life, and where they want to live before they pursue a career as a programmer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are amazingly gifted programmers sat all over the world, each capable of writing beautifully elegant and wonderfully efficient code.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many of them won’t need to earn as much as you to pay their rent.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the quality of output is materially the same, the main differentiator becomes price.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In a race to the bottom, those living in high cost of living locations get priced out of the market first.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The technology game is also brutally Darwinian. Technology trends change at an alarming rate. Hard-won skills and experience can become stale or irrelevant after a dishearteningly short period of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Re-skilling every 2-3 years just to remain employable is not uncommon for programmers. The novelty wears off that particular aspect of coding very quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My recommendation for people interested in a career in technology would be to focus on client-facing roles that cannot be easily outsourced or offshored. Roles that require both business and technology knowledge. These types of roles are also harder to replace with AI.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">When your hobby becomes your job, it quickly starts to feel like work rather than fun!<br />
Once I started coding for a living, I quickly lost all interest in tinkering with personal projects.<br />
That was unfortunate, as previously much of my free time had been devoted to torturing computers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tips for beginners?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Learn coding basics by completing some free/low-cost online courses offered by sites like <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://www.lynda.com/">Lynda.com</a>, and <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Becoming proficient at coding is like becoming proficient at music. Initially, you will be unspeakably bad. With time and a lot of practice, you will improve.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Identify an actual, tangible, problem you are personally experiencing. Now code yourself a solution. And repeat.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Vendor certifications are often an expensive waste of time and money.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you want to pursue a university degree then carefully consider the value of each institution’s brand. Perform an honest cost/benefit analysis on whether the tuition fees are actually worth having that brand on your degree or diploma.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example, the internationally renowned Oxford University and the largely unknown Oxford Brookes University share many student facilities and charge identical tuition fees. Yet one is far more likely to get you a job interview than the other.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Which technology area picks your brain most these days?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BostonDynamics/videos">work Boston Dynamics</a> are doing with robotics is fascinating.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What do you think is the biggest improvement/challenge the IT industry looking forward these days?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are several, but one of the big ones is managing “legacy hell”.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Recent ransomware attacks highlighted the huge number of organizations that depend upon technology platforms long past their useful life. It was alarming to see how much of the economy was held together by nothing more than duct tape and hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Decades of underfunding, shortsighted management decisions, and the absence of sustainable IT strategies have created a major vulnerability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The problem has existed for a long time. The core systems found at the heart of many major institutions still run on 1970s technology, written in arcane languages where the majority of skilled practitioners have long since retired or died of old age.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately, we keep repeating those same mistakes. For example, consider the vast numbers of web-enabled “Internet of Things” devices that ship with no viable means of patching security vulnerabilities.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">You’re still fighting the last war!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Worry about something you can control, like how you will pay the bills once AI begins to program themselves. The majority of programmers become structurally redundant at that point.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><em>Desktop OS:</em> macOS</li>
<li><em>Mobile OS:</em> iOS</li>
<li><em>Machine:</em> Xbox</li>
<li><em>Browser:</em> Chrome</li>
<li><em>Programming language:</em> Visual Basic for Applications… there is nothing Excel can’t do, but an awful lot that it shouldn’t!</li>
<li><em>And the most important… spaces or tabs:</em> gofmt and auto-fixing linters solved this</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Would you write a couple of lines of code to present a simple financial principle?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I would love to… but no.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Years ago my developers staged a mutiny and revoked my access to the tools.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is possible they were intimidated by the sheer awesomeness of the boss’s coding skills…. but unlikely!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They protested that when I was having fun crafting code, I wasn’t doing my day job: lining up new client projects, managing stakeholders, designing high-level solutions, and generally keeping them all gainfully employed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They were probably right. Identifying, and then focusing on, those unique things we can each do to sustainably add value is a sound financial operating principle.</p>
<h3>Epilogue</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Hey, look at him, he is alive, the guy who stated that he will get back on track with posting then disappeared.”</p>
<p>I know, I know and you are right. I should have been waking up <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wake-me-up-when-september-ends/">when September ends</a>. And now it is almost the end of October and all I published is a rant about <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/thanks-for-your-concern-suze-but-the-fire-movement-is-fine/">the Suze Orman phenomenon</a>. She <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/suze-orman-big-pivots-bad-publicity-always-seem-icky-said/">apparently “changed” her mind</a>, btw.</p>
<p>So what happened? Well, I try to stick with a new writing schedule and carve out 1-2 hours at least 2-3 evenings a week. Same time it seems I got more critical towards my writings, I accumulated four drafts so far but was not satisfied&nbsp;with (or did not finish) them. That&#8217;s why you have seen no posts. I felt that it would be better if I could publish one good article in a month than one crappier every week.</p>
<p>But don’t afraid, I was actually working on something in the last two weeks. Just not for my own blog. Carl, alias <a href="https://www.1500days.com/start-here/">Mr. 1500</a>, reloaded his <a href="https://www.1500days.com/10-questions/">10 questions series</a> a few months ago and kindly invited us, blogging noobies to participate. I jumped on the opportunity and did not want to phone it. I think I ended up with more than 20 answers and 3k words. I was tempted to answer them all but many of these would have been non-interesting one-liners so just skipped including those. Just in case you are curious about what would be my answer to any of them let me know in the comments section and I will fill the void.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p>Hey everyone, I&#8217;m a 37-year-old single woman from London, who works in the IT sphere. I&#8217;m working towards FIRE and have an anonymous blog, Ms ZiYou documenting my journey. I want to show women they can work in tech, and by my answers below, you&#8217;ll see you don&#8217;t need to be obsessed with computers to do so.</p>
<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<h3>When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t really know &#8211; there was one BBC basic computer I remember in our primary school, which must have been the first I used. We used it to play old school games, such as Grannys Garden. Computers weren&#8217;t really a thing. At my secondary school, there were a few more computers, but even the computing class had 3 students to one computer. And at university, there were a few more computers, but they were not everywhere. We had a uni email but no-one to email. A lecturer told our class he had emailed us something, and we laughed at him.</p>
<h3>What was your first machine?</h3>
<p>I never had my own computer until the last year of uni, and that was mainly used (with dial-up) for the new-fangled internet and writing up uni work. I have no idea what it was, but I do know it cost me £1000, which was a lot of money. But I had the internet at home!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been a gamer or even a hardcore programmer &#8211; I don&#8217;t think they are essential skills you need to work in the IT industry.</p>
<h3>What about education? Was it related to computing? Did you learn in a traditional way? What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p>I have a BEng in chemical engineering, a very STEM subject. We used Matlab a lot, did some Autocad. One the actual programming side, we were not a very good class academically but we had a collaborative spirit that now serves me well in the corporate world. There was one VB project, that the whole class mega-collaborated on. You have to remember, at this time no one had a computer of their own, and our department only had 6 computers for about a thousand students, and computing rooms that could be used out of hours. It was just easier to share a computer and work together.</p>
<h2>Career</h2>
<h3>When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</h3>
<p>After uni, I worked in engineering for a few years, then decided it wasn&#8217;t for me. I then looked at my options and took a part-time job in a call centre to work out what to do next. A few months later, a full-time analyst job that interested me came up, and I grabbed the opportunity with both hands. I thrived in the new job, and my programming career began. I taught myself VBA, SAS, and SQL, and my role grew. The first promotion I went for I didn&#8217;t get and was devasted, but then a promoted position was made for me (my job was regraded) and I managed to ace that interview. I then got an internal sideways move to another team and delved hardcore into a more technical role. It was great fun, and eventually, a promoted position was again made for me which I interviewed for and got. After doing my time in industry, I lucked upon a consulting job that was recruiting for my exact skillset. I relocated to London for the job, which was absolutely the right decision. And after a few years, I left to consult freelance myself.</p>

<h3>What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked in good places and less good places. What I will say is that culture is local, and one team in a department can be very different from another team. I&#8217;ve worked in places where 50+ hour weeks were expected, and the work hard, play harder culture encouraged. And in other places where apathy and death by committee is the norm. In reality, I&#8217;d encourage trying out lots of places, only then you will know what type of company and team really works for you.</p>
<h3>How do you see the situation of women in our field?</h3>
<p>Tech has a massive women-problem. And it&#8217;s multi-faceted. Women are neither studying STEM enough nor are enough applying for tech roles, so there are not enough women coming into the industry. But that&#8217;s not the real problem. Bigger issues become apparent in tech roles when women have a much bigger attrition rate and lower promotion rate. The brogrammer stereotype is the reality of lots of tech departments, and the culture is such a turn off to women.</p>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<h3>What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</h3>
<p>My personal finances are doing amazingly well, I&#8217;m well on my way to achieving financial independence, and on track to reach there in 2.5 years. If you want the actual numbers, you can find them all over my blog, starting on my <a href="http://www.msziyou.com/numbers">numbers page</a>.</p>
<h3>Tell us about your journey so far?</h3>
<p>I start seriously saving for early retirement in 2015 and ramped up my efforts in 2016. So now I&#8217;m 2.5 years into my 5-year plan and things are going well. My income helps me keep my savings rate of 80%, which is key to such an ambitious FIRE plan.</p>
<h3>How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</h3>
<p>There is no doubt, without earning six figures I would not have been able to get to financial independence so quickly. So I am very thankful that my skillset has parlayed into a high earning profession.</p>
<h2>Opinions</h2>
<h3>Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p>No regrets really, apart from not learning to make better money sooner in my career. I go into more details on <a href="http://www.msziyou.com/what-prevented-six-figures-earlier">this post</a> what prevented me from earning six figures earlier. But given I learned in the end, it&#8217;s not a big regret &#8211; we all make mistakes along the way.</p>
<h3>Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly a great field to move into, but you need to make sure you are doing it for the right motivations, not just for the money. If you are naturally curious, love solving problems and don&#8217;t rest until you find the perfect solution you&#8217;ll be a great fit. Likewise, if you can explain the complex, framework issues and explain a problem to a coder and a business person, there is also a role for you.</p>
<h3>Tips for beginners?</h3>
<p>Everyone has to start somewhere, and there is no such thing as a silly question. If you want to start coding, there really is no better time than now to start. There is an abundance of free courses and tools online, all you need is to dedicate some time and brain power.</p>
<h3>How would you encourage young girls to step on this path?</h3>
<p>From my perspective, we need to ensure that we are encouraging kids of both sexes to get interested in the sciences at an early age. We need to root out all biases and provide girls with amazing role models who they can aspire to emulate. I&#8217;d expect young girls to get the same education and guidance as young boys, and any deviations to be challenged.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-959 size-large" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/matrix-2975868_1920-1024x683.jpg" alt="Matrix Girl" width="640" height="427"></p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<h3>What are your short-term and long-term goals for the future both financially and professionally?</h3>
<p>My short term and long term plans are exactly the same at this stage.<br />
Professionally that&#8217;s an easy question &#8211; I just aim to keep in contract at good rates for the next 2.5 years. I&#8217;m at the stage I&#8217;ll basically do anything if they pay me the right amount.</p>
<p>And that 2.5 years is relevant financially, as that&#8217;s when I forecast I&#8217;ll have enough funds to declare myself financially independent. All I need to do is keeping in work, maintain the 80% savings rate and the stock market not to crash.</p>
<h3>As far as I know, you have been bitten by the travel bug. What are the most interesting places where you have been and what are on top of your bucket list?</h3>
<p>Life has been good to me on the travel front so far. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of Europe and been on some amazing long-haul trips. You can see my full country list in <a href="http://www.msziyou.com/a-country-a-year">this post</a>. Trips that were especially epic were Peru and the Inca Trail, a trip that been long on my bucket list. Another even more epic was a Serengeti safari and climbing Kilimanjaro. Weirdly I did not even originally want to go on safari, but it seemed silly to not go since it was next door and not that much extra money. However, on the safari I was blown away by the wildlife; nothing can compare you to seeing wild lions by your truck or wild giraffes and zebras.</p>
<p>My bucket list is long, as well as the 150 countries I have not yet been to there are loads of places I want to explore again or in more detail. Top of the realistic list at the moment is Italy; I just love the food and wine there. And long term, when I retire I am going to slow travel and live nomadically for a good few years.</p>
<h3>If you would start your own startup what would it be about?</h3>
<p>I am 100% ready for a startup but have not been visited by that great idea yet. I am always on the lookout, who knows when the idea will land. On a serious note, weirdly I&#8217;m pretty sure I could run a startup and do all the business stuff no problem, it&#8217;s just that idea that I can be truly utterly passionate about that has not yet arrived.</p>
<h2>Preferences</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Favorite&#8230;</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Desktop OS:&nbsp;</strong>Anything &#8211; I run Windows at home, but use a lot of Unix at work.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile OS:</strong>&nbsp;Android &#8211; I maintain an anti-apple policy.</li>
<li><strong>Machine:</strong>&nbsp;Anything &#8211; I&#8217;m not fussy, and all processing is done on the cloud nowadays.</li>
<li><strong>Browser:</strong> Chrome</li>
<li><strong>Programming language:</strong> I don&#8217;t really care anymore &#8211; I&#8217;m a gun for hire. I do love SAS though.</li>
<li><strong>And the most important&#8230; spaces or tabs:&nbsp;</strong>Tabs. Spaces suck.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Coding exercise</h2>
<h3>Would you write a couple of lines of code to present a simple financial principle?</h3>
<p>I also suck at these. Instead, I&#8217;d say that in the corporate world, being able to talk clients out of silly requests is a skill you should prioritise.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p><em>Thank you for contributing to the series, I really liked your answers. I am pretty impressed with your consistency in maintaining your 80% savings rate and fast-tracking your FIRE journey to five years. All this while resisting lifestyle inflation and still achieving travel and other goals. Kudos to you!</em></p>
<p><em>I also think that all kids should be encouraged to experiment with science. The only reason that I asked about girls because according to my experience they need more encouragement to step on this path, mainly because of the stereotypes. I honestly think that we need more balance between the genders in our profession and that&#8217;s why I am a big fan of organizations like <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a>. Having daughters myself I really hope that someday they will dive into the wonderful world of computing even if their final career decision will be totally different.</em></p>
<p><em>Hope you enjoyed this episode.&nbsp;</em><em>See you soon.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Welcome back geeky FIRE seekers. Today I brought you the story of my newest (ex)coder-blogger friend all the way from the heart of Europe. Shame on me, I only found out about the existence of their great blog,&nbsp;<a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/">WhatLifeCouldBe.eu</a>&nbsp; a couple of weeks ago but digging through it is in progress. It turned out that they are very close to us both in terms of family situations and geographical distance. Enjoy!</i></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p>Heya. I&#8217;m Rob. We&#8217;re a Scottish (her) Hungarian (him) couple with two young kids who reached FI at 32 years while living in Germany. We started investing in real estate, started several side hustles, a profitable business and also invest in the stock market with ETFs. After more than 10 years in Germany, we moved to rural Romania where I&#8217;m from and where my parents live.</p>
<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<h3>When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p>I picked the IT class at high school (9-12th grade) so I started with 14 years to learn about coding and by my 18th birthday I did my first proper piece of software.</p>
<h3>What was your first machine?</h3>
<p>It must have been around &#8217;97, it was an Intel Pentium 166Ghz, 1Gb HDD and&#8230; pff&#8230; less than 512Mb Ram. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It was a great PC. Later I&#8217;ve got a Voodoo graphics accelerator and I rocked Tomb Rider on it&#8230;</p>
<h3>Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p>Well, in Romania back then nobody bought licenses so I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time hacking some PC games to make them work. I&#8217;ve learned a lot. I think this was the reason we have so many good developers now in Romania.</p>
<h3>What about education? Was it related to computing? Did you learn in a traditional way? What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p>Yeah, it was IT focused. Algorithms, Pascal and it got quite sophisticated with Backtracking and Recursivity. I then went to IT&amp; Economics which was a really good choice since it gives you insight in so many areas like marketing, management, finances, accounting, HR, stock market etc plus, 50% was coding.</p>
<h3>When did you start to work? Was it in your field?</h3>
<p>I always wanted to be a web programmer (PHP &amp; MySQL) right from the start of university. I actually became one and started working in this area. A couple of years of professional coding was enough for me to realize I don&#8217;t enjoy that so much and I gradually switched to consulting.</p>
<h3>How did you become an entrepreneur?</h3>
<p>I think it all started back in 1999 or so when I&#8217;ve got a CD burner and burned CDs for people for money <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I made enough money to buy a Dial-Up modem <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I remember that&#8230; Later I started making money with building websites from scratch. On paper, I became an entrepreneur by coincidence. The Germans didn&#8217;t want to give me work permit so the solution was to become a freelancer. Which I did. This meant, that I could keep those few little clients I had before and also have a kinda fulltime job as well. This was quite nice.</p>
<p>This was also an important milestone in my life. As a freelancer, I didn&#8217;t have to pay state pension. This made me a bit worried about my pension. I knew I had to do something and the private pension plans were not very appealing so this is when we started investing in real estate.</p>
<h3>What kind of services did you provide?</h3>
<p>I did the usual little websites. It started from scratch then the frameworks (Joomla) appeared. Then PHP / MySQL / JavaScript coding followed. Before I &#8220;retired&#8221; I&#8217;ve only used JavaScript a bit.</p>
<h3>What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p>I didn&#8217;t really enjoy the fast-changing technology. It always felt a bit like hacking, especially with JavaScript. So I&#8217;m not the sort of person who sits in a dark room and codes all night. I&#8217;ve done that, now I know I don&#8217;t like it. The industry? Well, huge future. Software and algorithms are going to shape our future world more and more. Look at Uber, the world&#8217;s biggest taxi company who don&#8217;t really own cars. Look at Amazon, the biggest online shop who don&#8217;t really produce anything and the list could go on and on. If you learn how to code, you&#8217;re future proof.</p>
<h3>What were your biggest challenge, failure, and success?</h3>
<p>My biggest challenge was my first project. I had to build one for my graduation. I was so proud of myself. I felt like there are no limits to what I could build in that programming language (FoxPro). Loved the feeling.</p>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<h3>What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re FI for about 3 years now but, as it happens we&#8217;re still earning money with stuff we enjoy doing.</p>
<h3>Would you share your FI strategy and journey briefly?</h3>
<p>Basically, we&#8217;re pretty diversification freaks. We invested a lot in real estate (1st pillar), I started an online business (2nd pillar), we both have skills that we can use anytime to make money (3rd pillar) and all that left is going to the stock market (4th pillar) if we feel like it&#8217;s good time to invest. We wrote about this <a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2016/01/02/financial-independence-strategy">strategy here</a> and this is <a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2015/12/03/financial-independence-in-9-years/">how we reached FI</a> in detail.</p>
<h3>How did your profession affect your finances?</h3>
<p>Fun fact about us is, that our highest paying side hustle (150-209€/h) had nothing to do with our professions (<a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2016/01/24/how-to-earn-154-an-hour-without-a-degree">see details here</a>), which was a caretaker job we did for 1.5 years. So if you ask me whether you need to be a coder or engineer to reach FI, my answer would be absolutely not!</p>
<p>Still, being a coder and having experience in building websites helped us a lot reaching FI, no question about that. The thing is, that if you have a good idea for a portal, a software or an App it can catapult you into FI in no time (sometimes a year or less could be enough). It allows you to build your money-making-machine, your source of passive income if you use your skills wisely.</p>
<h2>Opinions</h2>
<h3>Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p>Being a coder helped my consultant career a lot. I had to deal with IT guys and they like to talk to consultants who know their &#8220;language&#8221;. Most consultants in my field didn&#8217;t have a coder background and for me, this made a huge difference.</p>
<p>If I could, I would change the educations system in a way that it allows kids to find their passion as quickly as possible and I would let them focus on that rather than learn about chemistry if you clearly want to become a coder.</p>
<p>What would I change in my career? I would start being properly self-employed a lot earlier.</p>
<h3>Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p>If they enjoy it yes. If not&#8230;no&#8230; One should do what one enjoys doing. But EVERYBODY should learn a bit of algorithms and coding early on so the can decide for themselves. It should be mandatory!</p>
<h3>Do you have some tips for beginners?</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t sit in front of the TV or on Facebook so much. Start thinking about what you really want to do. What do you want to build? Virtually everything could be learned from the internet. Start doing it. Invest in your education. Not necessarily money, but time.</p>
<h3>Whom do you recommend indulging in entrepreneurship?</h3>
<p>I think everybody should be offered the chance to try different forms of entrepreneurship. They could then choose for themselves if they enjoy doing it.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<h3>You are a coder, a freelancer, an internet marketer, an online business owner, a blogger, a community builder, a real estate investor, and who knows what else <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Would you share your goals and plans for these projects with us?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve quit my coding customers long ago so this is not an issue anymore&#8230; I&#8217;m an ex-coder <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I quit my consulting customers mid-2017. It paid well (over 100€/h) and I could do it remotely but I felt like my work doesn&#8217;t really have any impact on anything I felt even slightly meaningful so I dropped it.</p>
<p>My only business is my baby. I love watching it grow, watching all the new features it can do every other day. I like the fact that I can have a real positive impact on the lives of thousands of people. So yeah, I have no plans of stopping this although, who knows. Next year I might have my focus on other stuff.</p>
<p><a href="http://firehub.eu/">FIREhub.eu</a> is a project we started at the Financial Independence Week Europe 2017 with a few other European folks. It should be the home for everything about FIRE in Europe with a curated articles list, blogs list, Wiki, Events, and Podcasts. It&#8217;s a not-for-profit project and I&#8217;d like to see other people jumping onboard and see it grow. It&#8217;s also a platform we use to get to know many interesting people.</p>
<p><a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/fiwe-2018/">FIWE</a> &#8211; the Financial Independence Week Europe is a fun, not-for-profit conference-meetup that we started in 2016 and in June 2018 we have the 3rd edition. We love to meet new amazing people, make friends and connect people. We enjoy it a lot, it&#8217;s also something that Emma (my wife) and I are doing together (apart from our blog). It&#8217;s quite important for us as a couple to have shared projects.</p>
<p>On the real estate side, we don&#8217;t plan on expanding. In fact, we might even sell some in the future. We don&#8217;t really enjoy dealing with tenants. Luckily we don&#8217;t have to do that too much. It&#8217;s pretty passive.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget that we&#8217;re also parents to two really sophisticated, energy-intensive little creatures. I don&#8217;t even understand how we have time to do anything else&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh&#8230;we&#8217;re also environmental activists and we want to make the world plastic free and idiots free. I know we have a long way to go&#8230; but hey, you have to start somewhere&#8230; My next goal is to make my hometown sustainably cleaner and stop the authorities dumping all the plastic waste from the town into&#8230; you guessed it&#8230; a lake. Not nice isn&#8217;t it. It&#8217;s quite challenging to find solutions here without getting in trouble&#8230;</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p><em>Thank you, Rob, for participating in this series. It was very interesting to get to know your tech background and professional journey more. I honestly think that it is very interesting and we can learn a lot from you about hard work, following your dreams and most importantly bending the system to fit your goals <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>
<p><em>While this post is going online somewhere at a lovely place at Timisoara a bunch of European FIRE folks are gathering to have a great weekend at FIWE 2018 conference. A huge shout out to all of you and wishing a lot of fun, interesting conversations and plenty of good wine and food for the following days.</em></p>
<p><em>Hope you enjoyed this episode.&nbsp;</em><em>See you soon.</em></p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Brent and I grew up in British Columbia, Canada (various places). I work full time from my home in Saskatoon, Canada and live with my wife Betty. I enjoy blogging, coding, and writing; spent most of my youth, and young adulthood chasing the dream of financial freedom via the music business &#8211; I failed on every level imaginable &#8211; first marriage, dreams of musical success, my jobs, and my first attempts at Internet marketing.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">The Beginning</h2>
<h3><strong>When was your first encounter with computing?</strong></h3>
<p>In my father&#8217;s basement when I was a young child. I can&#8217;t remember the computer he started on, but I know he was writing with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC language</a>. There was no Internet back then, and I remember him using a lot of books he got from the library. He loved it.</p>
<p>Eventually, he went on to write programs for the company he worked for, and he tried other languages as well. I was fascinated with it, and he tried to show me the rudimentary structure of a computer.</p>
<h3><strong>What was your first machine?</strong></h3>
<p>Commodore 64C &#8211; with a monitor AND floppy disk! It was heaven. Green screen and all. My Dad was into Apple by then, so there was the ongoing discussion of what machine is better, etc. He was much better than I was, and he was 100% self-taught.</p>

<h3><strong>Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</strong></h3>
<p>Gaming at first, but soon after I was playing around with DOS. Never really became fluent in any language, but I still loved how code worked, and the possibilities it promised.</p>
<h3><strong>What about education? Was it related to computing? Did you learn in the traditional way? What kind of degree do you have?</strong></h3>
<p>None really of substance. I took an electronics technician course for a year (which I almost failed due to playing in the band and getting wasted) at <a style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;" href="http://camosun.ca/">Camosun College in Victoria</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">, and computers and computing language were part of the curriculum.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Career</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Until I was 23 I never had a full-time job, as I was pursuing a music career. I worked in restaurants washing dishes, prep-cooking, cleaning, etc.</p>
<h3><strong>What are your experiences about the industry?</strong></h3>
<p>Music was my first career. I played bars, wrote music, recorded music, and went on the road. I met a lot of interesting people and shared the stage (backing them up or playing with) with punk bands and eventually more musically accomplished bands (<strong>WARNING:</strong> <em>name drop time</em>). In punk rock we backed up D.O.A., The SubHumans, Husker Du &#8211; in the <a href="https://livevictoria.com/index.php?band_action=info&amp;bandid=22925">Trouble Boys</a> we backed up John Lee Hooker, The Heats from Seattle (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0raxefoB8Nc">CHECK THE HEATS OUT HERE!</a> &#8211; play in background &#8211; can you believe these guys never made it!), traded live guitar solos with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN1xzwt6oyA">Jerry Doucette</a> one time. I met some names like Bryan Adams, Loverboy, BTO, HeadPins, on the west coast of Canada. Later in the prairies I released a couple of solo albums and played with some other big Canadian players, and we backed up Blue Rodeo on the river once (that was fucking cool!) &#8211; it was a ton of fun, but I finally had to let it all go.</p>
<p>NO MONEY IN IT!</p>
<p>When I turned 23 my parents scraped me off the streets of Vancouver and I started an apprenticeship in aviation as a mechanic. That was my first real paying career until I was 42 years old.</p>
<p>Aviation was amazing at first. When I started with the airlines at the age of 27 I was single and had flight benefits for $5 a flight to anywhere in the world. It was really exciting &#8211; flying anywhere you wanted &#8211; free drinks and food on the plane, and buddy passes I could give to friends (some girls too!).</p>
<p>But that all wore off soon and I hated working shift work. I became interested in Internet marketing, and that became my main obsession when I was 42ish. For those who are much younger, keep that in mind &#8211; you still have lots of TIME! Don&#8217;t quit &#8211; keep going.</p>
<h3><strong>How many times have you changed jobs (and what kind of jobs were those)?</strong></h3>
<p>Oh God &#8211; In music is was all over the place. Got fired from bands, fired from a music store jobs, and such (marijuana and drink were &#8220;issues&#8221;). I had countless restaurant jobs, and in aviation I worked for 7 different companies and/or airlines.</p>
<h3><strong>How did you end up in your current job position?</strong></h3>
<p>I finally realized that I was meant to be self-employed. I had to be free to fail or succeed on my own terms. I quit my job at the airlines when I was in Calgary, and went full time into Internet marketing. My wife and I have been working out of home ever since &#8211; HUGE ups and downs for income, but we paid off our house a few years ago. We&#8217;re in the valley again since Google changed their algo &#8220;bigly&#8221; in early 2017.</p>
<p>But the adventure continues! Still, love typing and being creative &#8211; it&#8217;s still SO MUCH FUN.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-896" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/digital-marketing-1024x683.jpg" alt="digital marketing" width="640" height="427"></p>
<h3><strong>What were your biggest challenge, failure, and success?</strong></h3>
<p>In my adult life, my biggest challenge was substance abuse and an unrealistic vision of success in the music business. In childhood, my biggest challenge was deformed hips and legs that caused a lot of self-confidence issues (bullies suck).</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge in Internet marketing has been search engine ranking changes. We&#8217;ve had to start over 4 times now. It gets harder every time, but if you keep creating content you&#8217;ll eventually succeed.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Finances</h2>
<h3><strong>What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</strong></h3>
<p>My wife doesn&#8217;t have any debt now. Our house is worth around $550,000, our Toyota Highlander is paid off, we have $350,000 in retirement savings. Our goal is to keep our Internet income high enough to keep saving and easily pay our monthly bills.</p>
<p>More will be revealed!</p>
<h3><strong>Tell us about your journey so far?</strong></h3>
<p>Think I did that above &#8211; it&#8217;s been a wild ride for sure. From living in rundown dumps, lurking in dirty bars, flying around the world with the airlines, and spending so many years stoned out of my mind &#8211; if I drop dead tomorrow, I won&#8217;t feel jipped. I feel very fortunate. My second wife Betty and I are very happy (hardly ever fight), no more music obsessions, no drug and alcohol abuse, and our kids are financially secure as well.</p>
<h3><strong>How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</strong></h3>
<p>My finances were affected BADLY until I was in my early forties. I spent money on anything I wanted at the time, racked up debt, and didn&#8217;t care. My goals had nothing to do with financial solvency.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Opinions</h2>
<h3><strong>Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</strong></h3>
<p>Never! If I could go back in time again I would dive head first into coding. The possibilities are endless, and it&#8217;s artistic in nature. I&#8217;m actually not a great coder with a ground-up understanding of all elements. I only write code when I need a specific function on a website. That&#8217;s why I primarily use PHP, Javascript, and HTML.</p>
<h3><strong>Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</strong></h3>
<p>That&#8217;s a tough one. I can&#8217;t recommend anything to others because we all have different needs and desires. I would say this though: IF you like working on your own and you&#8217;re a natural introvert, it may work for you. If you love writing and you&#8217;re not afraid of the basic technologies (like blog platforms) I would go for it.</p>
<p>Creating content is an extremely artistic craft, so if love being creative, it might be for you.</p>
<h3><strong>Tips for beginners?</strong></h3>
<p>If you love writing and creating, stick with it. You can make it. BUT, if you want to make a lot of money you need to have some websites that are purely for profit. Make sure to pursue traffic that PAYS BIG &#8211; examples would be the Insurance, Financial, and Legal niches. You want to make as much money per CPA that you can. You want to find affiliate associations, they pay between $10-$30 whenever the visitor fills out a simple 4 field form. (examples would be <a href="https://www.curadebt.com/">CureADebt</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/">ShareASale</a>)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Goals</h2>
<p>You have a few irons in the fire. You are a musician, a writer, a blogger, an internet marketer, a coder, and who knows what else <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Would you share your goals for these projects with us? &#8211; My main goal is to promote my book, keep blogging, and working with the <a href="https://wefindlenders.com/">WFL Project out of Rancho Mirage</a>. They pay me well for coding and blogging. I&#8217;m also learning about their niche. I still a have few dozen websites that make affiliate commissions and Adsense income &#8211; enough to pay our bills + some.</p>
<h3><strong>What are your financial goals for the short and the long term?</strong></h3>
<p>Short term goals make enough online to stay out of the brute workforce, and long-term to travel a lot with my family.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Preferences</h2>
<p><strong>We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Favorite&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Desktop OS = Windows</p>
<p>Mobile OS = Apple/Mac</p>
<p>Machine = Dell</p>
<p>Browser = Chrome, and Firefox</p>
<p>Programming language = PHP and Javascript</p>
<p>And the most important&#8230; spaces or tabs? = Lean towards <em>Tabs</em>, but as long as it&#8217;s consistent.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Coding exercise</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Would you write a couple of lines of code to present a simple financial principle?</p>
<pre style="text-align: left;"><strong>$php_coding = "consistent cash";</strong>

<strong>echo ("Give me" . " " . $php_coding . "!");</strong></pre>
<p>Good luck all, and remember&#8230;.we are not our egos or our minds. ;- )</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><i>Welcome back geeky FIRE seekers. It&#8217;s not that I will publish the new episodes of the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/coders-of-finance/">Coders of Finance</a>&nbsp;series one day later, just this holiday mixed week was packed with AFK adventures and I was barely able to sit next to the monitor. As the weather becomes better and better the great outdoors is calling me and who am I to resist this calling <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></i><i></i></p>
<p><em>As I promised in the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/coders-of-finance-abandoned-cubicle/">last episode</a>&nbsp;this time my interviewee will be a real blogging rockstar. Besides filling his own blog with high-quality content he is the mechanic behind our beloved&nbsp;<a href="https://rockstarfinance.com/">RockStarFinance.com</a>. You probably guessed who is he so I pass the keyboard to him.&nbsp;</em><i>Take it over Steve.</i></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I’m Steve and I blog over at <a href="https://thinksaveretire.com/">ThinkSaveRetire.com</a>. My wife and I are 33 and 36, respectively, and we’re both retired from full-time work, financially independent and travel the country full-time in our 30’ Airstream travel trailer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-833" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/airstream1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Airstream Closeup" width="640" height="360"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">The Beginning</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had a computer in my room from a very early age &#8211; sometime in high school back in the mid-90s from what I recall. It was a Windows box. Before that, I used to dabble in DOS computing as a middle schooler, but nothing too in-depth.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What was your first machine?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The machine that lived in my room as a high school student was a Windows 95 machine most likely.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I’ve never been a gamer. In fact, I suck at playing games and never really enjoyed playing the vast majority of them. I was always more of a programmer and web developer.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What about education, was it related to computing, did you learn in a traditional way or something else? What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have a degree in information technology, but the vast majority of what I learned was self-learned. In fact, I was relatively underwhelmed with IT-related education. Of course, computer science programs would have provided a much more in-depth curriculum in programming.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Career</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Full-time, or any type of work? My first job was at Safeway as a bagger. Then, I worked for Ritz Camera selling cameras and equipment. My first job after college was a programming job for a large IT corporation in the U.S. I’ve never really liked any job. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://thinksaveretire.com/careers-information-technology-unfulfilling/">written about my experience with the IT industry</a> at some depth, and in short&#8230;it didn’t provide a lot of value or satisfaction for me. It paid well, though, and it was instrumental in my ability to retire early. It had a way of draining the life out of me.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Finances</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">No real financial goals at the moment other than not running out of money. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We are financially independent with about a million bucks.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us about your journey so far?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A lot of this is written in detail on the blog. <a href="https://thinksaveretire.com/performance-review-one-year-anniversary-early-retirement/">Here’s</a> a bit about how well things are going thus far. In short, we are enjoying things in our traveling lifestyle.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-834" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/airstream2-1024x658.jpg" alt="Airstream Camp" width="640" height="411"></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">My career in IT had a profound effect on our finances. We could never have retired from full-time work this early without high-paying IT jobs. Not even close. By the end of our careers, my wife and I were earning around $250,000 a year, and we saved the large majority of it.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Opinions</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">No regrets at all. Though my career wasn’t all that satisfying, it also enabled us to call it quits super early from full-time work, so I’d do it again in a heartbeat and wouldn’t change a thing.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Choose a marketable career, not your “passion”. Reject advice that would have you blindly follow your passion, especially if that passion isn’t a skill that companies are looking for. Passions very often don’t pay the bills. Marketable skills do. Luckily, information technology is a very common skill that nearly every company needs in some way, shape or form.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tips for beginners?</h3>
<p>Don’t be afraid to move around from time to time in your career. Moving companies will generally increase your salary far more than just getting promotions at the same company (though there are exceptions). I worked for a total of five different IT companies in my 12 years of working IT professionally.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Goals</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">You are not just the blogger behind ThinkSaveRetire.com but the mechanic behind Rockstar Finance and you have a YouTube channel also. Would you give us a sneak peek behind these projects?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I’m not too sure what kind of a sneak peek I can really give. It’s just a lot of legwork. Lots of reading and research. Lots of writing and, with the YouTube channel, video-editing. Sometimes it’s not glamorous, but as long as I’m still enjoying the process, I’ll continue pursuing all these different projects. Together, I’m probably putting four to six hours a day into all of these things, combined.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What are your short-term and long-term goals with it?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Honestly, I’m not much of a goal setter. I just like to keep improving month after month. These improvements can take the form of almost anything, like pageviews, revenue, Twitter engagements or anything else. I’m one of the few people, it seems, that doesn’t *need* to set and achieve goals in order to feel active and productive. As long as the trend points upward with whatever I’m involved with, that is generally good enough for me.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Preferences</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Favorite&#8230;</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Desktop OS:</strong> Windows 10</li>
<li><strong>Mobile OS:</strong>&nbsp;Android</li>
<li><strong>Machine:</strong> Architecture? No preference. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li><strong>Browser:</strong> Chrome</li>
<li><strong>Programming language:</strong>&nbsp;PHP</li>
<li><strong>And the most important&#8230; spaces or tabs:</strong>&nbsp;Tabs (I’m lazy)</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Coding exercise</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Would you write a couple of lines of code to present a simple financial principle?</h3>
<pre>if (spending &gt;= (income * .5)) {
  financialWeakness = true;
}</pre>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p><em>Thank you, Steve, for the great answers. I am happy for the opportunity featuring your story here. I hope that sooner or later not just the personal finance but the coder community will find this series and it is important to show everyone that where can a well paying IT job bring you in a relatively short career if you are handling your finances wisely.</em></p>
<p><em>Hope you enjoyed this episode. I</em><em>n two weeks I will bring you the first interview in this series with a female blogger.</em></p>
<p><em>See you soon.</em></p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hello! I’m a typical middle manager at a Fortune 500 company, residing in Minnesota, U.S.A. Our winters are long and the summers run way too short, so we all bite down on the stick and put up a good front for 7 months out of the year. I’m married with twin four-year-olds (boy and girl.) We enjoy walks in our city neighborhood and traveling to visit family and friends.</p>
<p>Having been in the cubicle workforce for a little over 20 years since college, I’ve come to appreciate the importance of not withering away my life in a box. So a few years back I started a blog,&nbsp;<i><a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AbandonedCubicle.com</span></a></i>, wherein I post about my early retirement strategy. It’s loaded with some good tips, but plenty of epic fails as well.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">The Beginning</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was in the sixth grade I think &#8211; must’ve been around 1984 or 1985? The Apple II was pretty popular. My cousins had one, and the school created a special room with about 12 of them for kids to learn computing on. At my cousins’ house, I enjoyed playing the very original Castle Wolfenstein. It was fascinating even in 2-D top-down. At school, I learned how to code some basic graphics schemes, interspersed with rounds of Oregon Trail.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What was your first machine?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I’m pretty sure our first computer was the Texas Instruments 99-4A. It was on its way out, but that didn’t stop my dad from thinking he’d made a steal of a deal to get one. Ha! The thing came with a standard issue cassette data recorder for saving your programs. It also had a cartridge slot for purchased programs and games. I spent a good amount of time programming basic on that beast while playing the occasional round of Burgertime. Remember that classic?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-815" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ti99_4a.jpg" alt="Texas Instruments 99-4A" width="640" height="359"></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you can see, I sort of dabbled in both starting out. I’m glad I did because it gave me an appreciation for the amount of work that went into making those games happen.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What about education, was it related to computing, did you learn in a traditional way or something else? What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There were a couple of computer classes available to us in grade school, and both were labs stocked with Apple IIs and IIIs. Those machines were great for learning basic, and they seemed pretty reliable. I’ll never forget my high school computer teacher almost having a nervous breakdown after some knuckleheads nearly electrocuted themselves messing with the outlets…</p>
<p>Apart from that, I basically was self-taught. I eventually got a hold of a Commodore 64 and began to program some fancy statistical baseball utilities. (I could’ve been Billy Beane if I had the ability to catch pop ups during high school tryouts!) I also enjoyed trying to make my own scenario games, like Zork. Trouble was, (and is), I have a short attention span. So my games never lasted more than 5 minutes!</p>
<p>I took a computer course in college and even got my first PC while working towards my degree in SOCIAL SCIENCE back in the early 90s. Why I didn’t pursue computers for a career I’ll never know. Because I’ve always been in tech since graduating, despite my non-tech degree.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Career</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Full-time? Right after graduation from college. I spent my first two years working call center jobs supporting point of sale registers and eventually corporate desktop software. Definitely NOT in my field. I also realized how quickly I needed to step up my game since I knew I didn’t want to keep taking calls day after day.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p>After those first two years, I had the opportunity to move on and become an on-site support tech. Instead of handling issues over the phone, I got to bounce around from desk to desk, helping grain traders with their PC issues. This was super rewarding. You got to know some great people who thought you were the best thing since Superman merged with Sheldon (though Sheldon wasn’t around back then.)</p>
<p>I also got to take apart PCs and upgrade hardware, though the dust bunnies were annoying. I like working with my hands so that was a lot of fun. We also got into imaging laptops and learned about secure connections and VPNs.</p>
<p>Within a couple years of desktop support, I moved on to client-server support and building web pages. Again, these five years were the highlight for me in tech. Course, you always look back and remember the good stuff, right? To be fair, there were times I had to crawl between desks with dress clothes and tie, battling all sorts of dust, crud, and what not, to plug in machines and route cables.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Finances</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I’ve got my act together, money-wise. I’d definitely be retired by now if I had had my act together <a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/million-dollar-decade/">before I turned 40</a>! The master plan is for me to retire early from cubicle work in 2019, not too far off. My wife is almost 10 years younger, and she’ll be in position to retire early as well when she reaches my current age.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us about your journey so far?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">It’s been full of ups and downs. Mainly just from a perspective of little first world problems, like <a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/where-should-you-live/">whining about Minnesota winters</a>. That and losing some of the freedom you had as a couple without kids. With kids, we’re proud and happy as a family, but we miss some of the travel and spontaneous stuff you can do, sans kids.</p>
<p>With money, we simply have stayed the course. No extravagant purchases and we are happy with our humble little house. Two cars paid for in the garage. And the mortgage is getting paid down slowly but surely.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Interesting question. I think choosing a field in Information Technology has worked out rather well. Tech is a lucrative field that pays well, often because, in my opinion, non-tech people are too scared to realize how accessible tech really is!</p>
<p>I haven’t made big-big money like an Oracle DBA or world-class programmer, but I’ve done well for myself. Credit part of that to achieving my MBA about fifteen years ago.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/it_crowd_douglas.jpg" alt="IT Crowd Douglas" width="300" height="340"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Opinions</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This doesn’t apply to me. I’ve never been a coder, even though I’ve dabbled in some HTML and Basic.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Absolutely! Learn a bit and see if you like it. Worse case, you gain an understanding of how so much of IT works.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tips for beginners?</h3>
<p>Get a PC and take it apart. Put it back together again. Play some computer games. Try your hand at coding something. Join a club and learn from a mentor.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Goals</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">You are about reaching FIRE soon. Do you have plans on starting any passion projects when you finally escape the rat race, besides your AirBnB side hustle? Would you give us a sneak peak?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Too early to say. I’ve thought about house flipping though. That would let me get my hands dirty!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What are your short-term and long-term goals with it?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Short term &#8211; <a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/cubert-fraud/">avoid boredom</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Long-term &#8211; <a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/freedom/">secure our financial future</a>, and give my kids a chance to learn some hands-on home remodeling skills.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Preferences</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Favorite&#8230;</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Desktop OS:</strong> Win XP&nbsp;<em>(I have to confess that I share this preference, my favorite Win)</em></li>
<li><strong>Mobile OS:</strong>&nbsp;Apple</li>
<li><strong>Machine:</strong>&nbsp;xBox first edition</li>
<li><strong>Browser:</strong>&nbsp;Firefox</li>
<li><strong>Programming language:</strong>&nbsp;Basic (LOL)</li>
<li><strong>And the most important&#8230; spaces or tabs:</strong> Jesus. I dunno … tabs? <em>(Yes, that is the correct answer :))</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Coding exercise</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Would you write a couple of lines of code to present a simple financial principle?</h3>
<pre>If “Savings”, &lt;=0 then “Retirement” = “No can do!”

<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p><em>Thank you, Cubert, for your answers. It was fun to get some insights into the not strictly coder type of corporate job. You are another living example that handling your finances wisely, working hard and sticking to the plan ripens its fruits. Congrats for reaching this goal so early, I envy your kids <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><i>Welcome back geeky FIRE seekers. This week I brought you geeky insights about another one of our fellow coder-bloggers, all the way from the Twin Cities. He goes with the alias Mr. BoaS and blogs over at <a href="https://www.budgetonastick.com">www.budgetonastick.com</a>.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><i>I love to read his insightful posts on&#8230; well, pretty much everything. He is more of a &#8220;man of numbers&#8221; than me, but we share a lot of interests besides coding.

Ok, I am doing the last part only in theory, but still am excited about it.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><i>To be honest I have another reason to find his blog interesting. As they are a family of four with a coder dad who has similar interests I see their story as a huge &#8220;what if&#8221; to <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/escaping-the-matrix/">ours</a>. I know that there is no point in comparing others lives to ours, but let&#8217;s be honest, we all do this every sometimes.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><i>Take it over BoaS.</i></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am Mr. BoaS. I write gibberish full time and write on my site, Budget On A Stick, on the side. When not doing either I am hanging out with my wife, Ms. Blue Ribbon and our two boys, Mini Donut and Babe.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">The Beginning</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I was a kid my parents bought an IBM Windows 3.1 machine so they could do book work on it for their business. I mainly only got to play with Paint, Minesweeper, and Solitaire. Occasionally, I could play with the banner and card making software that was on it (but only if someone would help me with the commands for it).</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What was your first machine?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I didn’t get my own machine until high school. It was a Gateway with a 3.2 GHz Pentium 4 processor (I think). When I ordered it the representative thought I was crazy for wanting a WHOLE gig of RAM (pretty sure my phone has more than that now). I loved that box. I’d probably liken it to the love my dad had for his first car.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I started off just having it for video games. Before computer gaming, I had a healthy history gaming on the Original Nintendo and Nintendo 64. I also liked using the machine to create videos with my friends (that was a big deal before YouTube). Not too long after that, I was using the machine to help me learn Java, C++, and Python. I had those three languages under my belt before I moved on to college.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What about education, was it related to computing, did you learn in a traditional way or something else? What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since I loved working with computers and playing with programming languages I knew I wanted to be a programmer after college. I went the traditional route and got my degree in Software Engineering from UW-Eau Claire.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Career</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I graduated in 2010 and started working for an insurance company writing in Java. That was fun but I quickly moved over to a team that was doing Sharepoint development (my first taste of C#). I really like C# and have been coding in that since. Thank god I’m not still writing Sharepoint code.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p>There are two types of companies in this world:</p>
<ol>
<li>An industry company that has an IT group that makes software</li>
<li>A software company that writes for an industry</li>
</ol>
<p>What I mean is I’ve worked for companies where the software that is making the company competitive isn’t getting the focus it needs to make the company great. I’ve also worked for companies that changed their focus to be software companies that specialize in a particular industry. These companies use their competitive advantage and blow away the competition.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Finances</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What is your current financial situation/ are your current financial goals?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are debt free except for the mortgage. I have charted a course for us to be financially independent by 40 but my current goals are to get our Roths maxed and eventually my 401k. I try to have yearly goals and five-year goals to make sure we are always moving forward.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us about your journey so far?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">It has been stressful. We got ourselves into debt with our solar panels and car loan but after our son was born we got our act together. Using the debt snowball and throwing everything we could at the loans we broke free.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Did the income help?&#8230;yes but income isn’t everything. I think my extreme data analytical attitude helped me create plans and execute them. Perhaps the reason why so many engineers are part of the FI community is because we are always trying to hack the system and are thinking of all the angles&#8230;angels…*Googles angels*&#8230;yeah angles.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Opinions</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not in a million years. I love being a programmer. I want to do it as long as I can but I know that there will come a day where I may not be able to keep up with the new languages or platforms. For that reason, I want to make sure I have the option to retire early.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Do what makes the most sense for you. If that is university then do that but if you’d rather do a community college or boot camp program go for it. I’ve done this long enough to know it doesn’t matter which one you do as long as you make the most of it.</p>
<p>No matter your background you have something to contribute. I have co-workers with social science degrees (great for user behavior) and co-workers with art/design degrees (great at making cool looking UIs).</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tips for beginners?</h3>
<p>Learn to learn anything. Languages are constantly evolving and frameworks are here one day, gone the next. In this ever-changing world, the best skill a programmer can have is the ability to learn something new.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Goals</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Please tell us about the story behind Thrifty, your SaaS project.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The financial goals for us are ramping up our savings to hit the FIRE date. I try to make short-term goals each year to help get us to that long-term goal. Professionally, I just try to push myself each year, get on the high-profile and complex projects. That is a great way of increasing growing the gap between savings and spending. Although, high risk/high reward. If the project fails you better have something good to show for it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What are your short-term and long-term goals with it?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I’ve recently flipped the switch on having Thrifty be a paid subscription with a free trial period. Short-term, I’m hoping to get a *bit* better at my sales/promotion skills so I can at least make enough to cover my hosting fees <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Long-term, I’ve got a feature list that could take me years to complete, including developing iOS and Android apps. Depending on where the mini-retirement takes me and how well it does financially, I could happily work on Thrifty for years to come as a full-time gig.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Preferences</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Favorite&#8230;</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Desktop OS:</strong> Windows 7? I don’t know, only use my work one. Do ChromeOS count? <em>(of course)</em></li>
<li><strong>Mobile OS:</strong>&nbsp;Android.</li>
<li><strong>Machine:</strong>&nbsp;ASUS Chromebook Flip C302</li>
<li><strong>Browser:</strong>&nbsp;Chrome</li>
<li><strong>Programming language:&nbsp;</strong>C# and Javascript</li>
<li><strong>And the most important&#8230; spaces or tabs:&nbsp;</strong>Tabs. If I press the tab key I better get a tab <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>

<p><em>Thank you, BoaS, for the answers. You made me laugh with the angles/angels debate (I had to google too <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).</em></p>
