<p><em>Another case of instant post writing invoked by <a href="https://thesavingninja.com/category/thought-experiments/">SavingNinjas&#8217; thought experiment</a> asking &#8220;What is the toughest job you have ever performed?</em>&#8220;<em>. Let&#8217;s jump into the middle and let the stream of consciousness flow. </em></p>



<hr>



<p>The wind was chilly.</p>



<p>The coldest December of recent years.</p>



<p>The temperature was below zero all day long.</p>



<p>At least that was my guess as we did not have a chance to experience it.</p>



<p>In the lazy warmth of the factory hall, we did not have any sense of the outer world.</p>



<p>The monotonous sounds of the gigantic machines almost put us into sleep.</p>



<p>This was our third day and the most boring so far.</p>



<p>The kind when you would like to check the clock every minute just to get disappointed by the painfully slow passing of time.</p>



<p>The rolls of damaged plastic were slowly digested by the so-called regranulator.</p>



<p>I walked to the other end where the small white balls were coming out and disappearing in a hole.</p>



<p>Holding a T-shaped piece of metal in my hand I executed the movements my supervisor showed me.</p>



<p>I had no idea what I was doing.</p>



<p>It did not make any sense to me and I saw no use of it.</p>



<p>But I followed the instructions.</p>



<p>I did not have anything better to do anyway.</p>



<p>I was alone in the room and there was another half an hour or so till I had to fill the bags from the tank again.</p>



<p>Good that we only accepted this job for two weeks.</p>



<p>I only remember that we had a goal in mind about what to do with the money we will earn.</p>



<p>Maybe spend on Christmas gifts? Maybe something else, I cannot really recall.</p>



<p>But I remember well our desperation.</p>



<p>Two weeks were left until the winter holidays.</p>



<p>We had our grades closed for the semester and had the blessing of our teachers to leave school early.</p>



<p>The second grade of high school is not that important after all.</p>



<p>My friend and I were testing the waters of student jobs already but so far it meant only handing out flyers.</p>



<p>This was more serious.</p>



<p>Replacing some plastic factory workers who had to take sick-leave before the holidays.</p>



<p>Maybe coincidence. Maybe not.</p>



<p>We had to get up around half-past five in the morning to do our homework and school preparations.</p>



<p>Be in the canteen at seven having breakfast and reach the first class at 7:30.</p>



<p>Then survive the first part of the day, having a hasty lunch, and leave early to reach the bus.</p>



<p>Showing up at the factory reception exactly at 2 PM.</p>



<p>Eight hours later leaving the plant, rushing to the bus, getting back to the dorm, have a modest dinner, take a shower, and fell asleep immediately.</p>



<p>Rinse and repeat for two weeks. </p>



<p>I felt it was a huge commitment but I felt we can tough it out.</p>



<p>On the first day, we had to package palettes of freshly produced plastic foil rolls.</p>



<p>We were doing the work of a machine which got faulty.</p>



<p>They fixed it on the next day so we were sent over to another room.</p>



<p>We had to feed a tall machine.</p>



<p>Two bags with the blue text on them, one with the orange stamp repeating every five minutes.</p>



<p>Staring on the &#8220;flying&#8221; melted plastic in between.</p>



<p>The next day we were moving on again.</p>



<p>My friend was collecting plastic rubbish around the whole factory.</p>



<p>I was receiving it at the regranulator and feeding it into the machine.</p>



<p>This day was the slowest of all.</p>



<p>I think that was the day when I decided that I don&#8217;t want to work in a monotonous, illogical, meaningless job.</p>



<p>Some days I question if I succeeded in this.</p>



<p>An eternity later we were standing at the bus stop again.</p>



<p>Fooling around the bus stop sign.</p>



<p>Its rod was made out of some kind of metal.</p>



<p>If you touched it your hand got frost to it immediately.</p>



<p>For some reason, it popped into my mind that what would happen if I touch it with my tongue.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I was acting faster than thinking.</p>



<p>Realized my huge mistake only when it was too late.</p>



<p>Terrified from the potential consequences I backed off immediately.</p>



<p>This was my second mistake.</p>



<p>I felt the sharp pain immediately on the top of my tongue and the salty taste of blood in my mouth.</p>



<p>It hurt but we were laughing so hard that there were no room for self-pity.</p>



<p>Being able to laugh at your own stupidity can be a lifesaver.</p>



<p>It took about a week for my skin to fully recover.</p>



<p>By the time we left the factory and that job behind, the pain was long gone.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s left is a funny anecdote and the memory of our achievement.</p>



<p>This was the first and toughest job of my life but we survived and excelled it.</p>



<p>I promised myself that if there is a way I will not accept such a mind-numbing and soul-crushing job again.</p>



<p>So far so good&#8230;</p>
