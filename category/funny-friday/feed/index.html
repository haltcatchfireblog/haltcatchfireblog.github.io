										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A long time has passed since I have posted a Funny Friday post and even that was a <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/funny-friday-best-of-edition/">wrap-up and a farewell</a> from the series. Then I stated that I will retire the series and will focus on <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/memes-reloaded/">creating single memes</a>. As it turned out this is not working very well and recently I was reminded that once I have this periodical memes post which was funny. So I thought that I will put together an issue once more and will check if people still interested. Same time the best memes were born when I got inspiration from other blog posts so will follow this path. Thus the title became VIP which in this case means Very Interesting Post.</p>
<p>Hope you will enjoy them <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://www.mysonsfather.com/why-i-dont-calculate-my-fi-date/">Why I Don’t Calculate My FI Date</a></h2>
<p>MSF over at <a href="http://www.mysonsfather.com">MySonsFather.com</a> back in April had a wonderful idea about having a bear week to educate about bear markets. However, my favorite post was which included <a href="http://www.mysonsfather.com/why-i-dont-calculate-my-fi-date/">real bears</a>. If you ever experienced such an encounter you will bear it in mind for the rest of your life (pun intended). He even tricked other bloggers to write bear posts, you can check out the <a href="http://www.mysonsfather.com/bear-week-round-up/">wrap-up here</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-874" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/msf_bear.jpg" alt="MySonsFather - Bear" width="500" height="666"></p>
<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/where-should-you-live/">Where Should You Live?</a></h2>
<p>Cubert over at <a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/">abandonedcubicle.com</a> started to (whine)talk about the <a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/where-should-you-live/">cold Minnesota weather</a> and sketched some life improvement pathways. Despite I don&#8217;t really have problems with our climate (at least most of the times) I found it interesting because it made me think if I live at the right place taking every aspect into account. A thought experiment which I have to carry on I think.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-872" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ac_office.jpg" alt="AbandonedCibicle - Office" width="526" height="440"></p>
<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/2018/05/16/women-on-fire-frogdancer/">Women on FIRE – Frogdancer</a></h2>
<p>Liz over at <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org">ChiefMomOfficer.org</a> keeps doing a great job interviewing and presenting awesome and inspiring freedom stories about exceptional women who did not let the standards and stereotypes to crush their finances and did their best to achieve their goals. No surprise that with such a FIRE in their souls they are killing it. Recently I read this wonderful story she shared about another blogger mom, <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/2018/05/16/women-on-fire-frogdancer/">Frogdancer</a> (I love this name :)) who was able to achieve financial independence as a single mother of four boys (have all my respect). Initially, I created a &#8220;How tough I am?&#8221;, then an &#8220;Insanity wolf&#8221; meme about her situation but I hate SpongeBob and was not sure about the appropriateness of the latter so ended up with Kermit.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-877" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cmo_frog.jpg" alt="ChiefMomOffice - Frog" width="500" height="500"></p>
<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://mysterymoneyman.com/debt-freedom-a-musicians-story/">DEBT FREEDOM: A MUSICIAN’S STORY</a></h2>
<p>I love that we have musicians in our ranks and even more that they cooperate <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> A few weeks ago MMM of <a href="https://mysterymoneyman.com">MisteryMoneyMan.com</a> shared an awesome <a href="https://mysterymoneyman.com/debt-freedom-a-musicians-story/">debt freedom story</a> from the pen of Brent Truitt of <a href="http://wefindlenders.com/">WeFindLenders.com</a> &amp; <a href="https://debtfiles.com/">DebtFiles.com</a>. If you like his stories as much as I do check out his fresh outta oven eBook, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heroes-Villains-Bankrupt-Bullshitter-Truitt-ebook/dp/B07D1TY3G8">Heroes &amp; Villains of a BANKRUPT BULLSH*TTER</a> (not an affiliate link).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/mmm_whats_burning.jpg" alt="MisteryMoneyMan - Burning" width="666" height="500"></p>
<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/401k-scam-part/#comments">The 401(k) Is a Scam</a></h2>
<p>ERD over at <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com">EarlyRetirementDude.com</a> recently published the first post in a trilogy with the not least intriguing title than &#8220;<a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/401k-scam-part/#comments">The 401(k) is a scam</a>&#8220;. I expected that haters will have a huge raid against his point but the waters are relatively still and peaceful. At least until now. Keep an eye on the sequels.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-875" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/erd_joker.jpg" alt="EarlyRetirementDude - 401k" width="463" height="350"></p>
<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/best-money-memes/">A Page Full of #Money Memes</a></h2>
<p>And last but not least I borrowed this meme from J$ who reminded me of this series and the importance of having financial memes at hand. A good laugh makes everything better and finances are no exception. If you feel that you need more memes check out the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/funny-friday/">Funny Friday archives</a> then jump over to <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/">BudgetsAreSexy.com</a> to have some <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/best-money-memes/">more here</a>.

<p>This day came earlier than I thought. Today I will finish the Funny Friday series. But don&#8217;t be afraid, memes will not disappear from my blog, just they will be published in a different way. My intent with this change is to maximize fun while minimizing time wastage. So, memes will return to the blog in a new way in January, but to give a proper closing to this series I collected the best of them. Enjoy and come back for more fun next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey All, yes it seems I am still here. To be honest, I was not sure about continuing this Funny Friday series, however, these were the most popular here. It is a little bit hard to compose a whole set of memes and find a topic as most of the time inspiration comes randomly and for a single meme. This will highly impact the future of these series but will tell more about that next week.</p>
<p>This week the situation was the same when I was reading&nbsp;<a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/how-do-you-hide-your-wealth/">How Are You Stealthy With Your Wealthy?</a>&nbsp;form J$. I noted that his post could fill a Funny Friday episode and he&nbsp;gave &#8220;full permission to do so&#8221;. I really liked the article, hiding your wealth is really boosting it under the hood. In the post, there were five bullet points which I want to present here with a meme each, just in reverse&nbsp;order (you will see in the end the reason :)).</p>
<h2>#5. I eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches 4 days a week</h2>
<p>I have no idea about this thing, but many people worship it so it has to be the food of the gods.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-595" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_pbj.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500"></p>
<h2>#4. I live in a 1,100 sq ft place which is literally the smallest house on the block</h2>
<p>This surprised me as this seems a reliable size to me, we are living in a roughly similar sized house. Also, the $2200 monthly rent blew my mind, you could rent a house for a year here (if you find one to let).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-594" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_house.jpg" alt="" width="616" height="462"></p>
<h2>#3. I’ve become a pretty good minimalist</h2>
<p>This is a trick I am using myself, our laptops are the most expensive things in the house. I have a friend and when we were at his place his father told us &#8220;always be sure to lock the doors, otherwise someone could bring in something&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-593" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_santa.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="450"></p>
<h2>#2. My clothes are riddled with holes</h2>
<p>I am guilty of this too, however, my wife always has an eye on my clothes while doing the laundry. This means that every now and then some hole riddled piece miraculously&nbsp;get lost. Needless to say not my relique clothes which are the only leftovers of my teenage years. Dumping my band name (not brand name) hoodies would be a straight case of divorce.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-592" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_holes.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="356"></p>
<h2>#1. I rock a mohawk</h2>
<p>This point needs no comment. Honestly, I think everybody deserves to have a mohawk at least once in a lifetime. It would change the perspective of the whole world, trust me or just ask Jim from <a href="https://www.routetoretire.com/first-24-hours-j-money-mohawk/">Route To Retire</a>&nbsp;who was brave enough to try it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-591" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_mohawk.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="697"></p>
<p><em>Note: it blew my mind when I found this image. Is it just for me or the similarity is strong with this? I imagine J$ like that when he will be appr. 76 years old and picking the brains of youngsters who question his financial skills because of his hear cut.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s&nbsp;it for now, share with me in the comments if you liked this series. And stay tuned, I will have news about the future next week. Have a Funny Friday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I published my first <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/tuesday-rant-six-figure-problem/">rant post</a> and it became one of the most viewed posts in no time. Of course, I faced some arguments, but fortunately from the good kind.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-564" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_12_most-interesting_man.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Most Interesting Man" width="500" height="627"></p>
<p>While I can accept their points I still stick to my opinion but tried not to be rude.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-563" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_12_not_sure.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Not Sure" width="552" height="414"></p>
<p>Maybe that is because I have seen too many people complaining while their actions didn&#8217;t show any real endeavor to change their situation. The following example is based on true story. If you take smoking into account only as any other luxury habit which eats up 20% of your family budget then, in my opinion, it is a space for cutting back.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-562" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_12_willy_wonka.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Willy Wonka" width="504" height="500"></p>
<p>I have to admit that I am not less guilty living in a modern(?) country than any one of you, but people should really have to learn to live within their means and avoid developing those so-called first world problems.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-561" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_12_first_world_problem.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - First World Problems" width="552" height="367"></p>
<p>A lesson I learned as a coder which is very helpful in any field sounds like the saying &#8220;where there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way&#8221;. If you are not happy with your situation you should research your opportunities instead of just complaining about it and blame it on others.</p>

<p>After all, that is why we are lurking here in this corner of the internet, to learn about earning, saving, investing and avoiding money failures <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>This is an unrelated rant about a recent event I read about. This is a message to companies which are going too far.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you walk in the day of light these days it is inevitable to hear someone talking about <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/the-best-investment-advice/">investing</a> or mining Bitcoins. These mysterious things called cryptocurrencies are around for while, but only recently got into the spotlight that much that next time when you will visit your grandma she will probably asking you about them too. This popularity caused by a recent huge appreciation of Bitcoin, which caused this modern investing fever we have not seen since the 19th century gold rush.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-520" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_ask.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Afraid To Ask" width="490" height="480"></p>
<p>I will not go into details about what Bitcoin is, if you want to know more about this digitally revolutionary thing, then please check this free video course by <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking/bitcoin/v/bitcoin-what-is-it">Khan Academy</a>. It provides a lot of interesting information about the whole topic, but I think you did not come here for teachings on a Funny Friday, did you?</p>
<p>Then what will be the memes about then? Well, I took my thoughts and opinions on the topic and mixed up with some interesting facts randomly.</p>
<h2>Satoshi Nakamoto</h2>
<p>The person or the group who released the concept are hiding behind the aforementioned name. The real identity of the creator is unknown, however, there are some theories about it. One of them is that this name is a simple mixture of the names of the four tech giants SAmsung, TOSHIba, NAKAmichi and MOTOrola. My only problem with this approach is that if these four giant companies unite forces to create such a thing there is no chance that they would ever be able to keep it in secret. My favorite version is that in the real world the cryptographer, Nick Szabo is the real Satoshi. I have to admit that I am biased on this because he is a fellow Hungarian <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> but he is a real expert on the topic, even Tim Ferris recorded a podcast with him with the title <a href="https://tim.blog/2017/06/04/nick-szabo/">“The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency”</a>. He denies the statement, but I cannot blame him. I would do the same if I had approximately 1 million Bitcoins which worths ten billion dollars at current value.</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-524" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_nick_szabo.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Yoda" width="475" height="547"></h2>
<h2>Bitcoin Investing</h2>
<p>In the recent years, but especially in this year a hundreds of posts were published on the topic of Bitcoin investing. However it sounds legit for the everyday people the proud members of our community knows exactly that this is pure speculation. Of course despite this fact it can be very profitable as the change in the price of one BTC from the beginnings exceeds 200.000%. Not a bad ROI, huh?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-521" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_roi.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Shut Up" width="500" height="281"></p>
<h2>The Most Expensive Pizza Ever</h2>
<p>The first documented purchase of a good with Bitcoin was made by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Laszlo_Hanyecz">Laszlo Hanyecz</a>. He bought two Domino&#8217;s pizzas for the astonishing amount of 10.000 BTC on May 17, 2010. On todays value it would be almost $10M, hope the restaurant was wise enough to keep them. To commemorate the transaction, May 22 became the&nbsp;Bitcoin Pizza Day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-522" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_pizza.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Bad Luck Brian" width="475" height="562"></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mining</h2>
<p>Bitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger. Anyone with internet connection and proper hardware can participate, but there are giant corporations who are dominating the crypto mining world. There are huge factory buildings in China stuffed with computer parts, running all the time and make their owners wealthier and wealthier every single minute.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-525" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_mine.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="666"></p>
<h2>What Is The Future</h2>
<p>As they say &#8220;No one can predict the future&#8221;. Some say this crypto thing is just another bubble which will burst soon. Others are fanatically putting all their money into it. Who will be right in the end? Who knows. The opponents say that these &#8220;coins&#8221; has no intrinsic value. The advocates say that it has the same attributes as real gold and it will bring the digital revolution to our world. Personally, I think that both sides are right. In terms of profitability and price appreciation I think the hype is strong with this one and sooner or later the bubble will burst. On the other hand, the technology, especially the newer improved variations, like Ethereum and many others are very promising and I believe that it will bring some kind of tech revolution.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-528" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_not_sure.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Not Sure" width="552" height="414"></p>
<p><em>What do you think about the topic? Do you have BTC &#8220;investments&#8221;? Do you think it&#8217;s a bubble? Please share your thoughts with me in the comments!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago I noticed on twitter that people started to talk about buying meat and making sauce and holiday spending (yes I am talking about you J$ and Justin). At first, I got confused because there is a couple of weeks left until Christmas shopping kicks in. The from other comments I realized that I am an idiot, there will come be Thanksgiving and Black Friday soon in the US.</p>
<p>Similarly to <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/who-killed-my-halloween/">Halloween</a>, this is not a holiday we celebrate here in my homeland. Of course, I know from my childhood television consumption that it has to do something with settlers, indians and turkeys. To my excuse, this happening was presented to me by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VbYZDohsHk">Wednesday Addams</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-458" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_wednesday.gif" alt="Funny-Friday-Wednesday" width="500" height="250"></p>
<p>A couple of years ago the commercial infection brought us the Black Friday too (totally unrelated to the above). While in Serbia we cannot talk about an epidemic , the spread in Hungary is more severe. Just for some strange reason, they hold it a week earlier so it happens today. On this occasion, I dug the net (and my head) for some meme ideas. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Can not think of a better kickstart for any topic than the good old Ned.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-469" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_ned_stark.jpg" alt="" width="622" height="477"></p>
<p>On the quest of taking advantage of the Black Friday discount, this was me today.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-468" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_bad_luck_brian.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="562"></p>
<p>Then I came to this conclusion. (Yes, Ned again… I mean Boromir… whatever)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-467" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_boromir.jpg" alt="" width="568" height="335"></p>
<p>Then finally had luck with finding an item which is almost identical to the one I was looking for.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-466" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_success_kid.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>Now that I know about the events over there this question seems relevant.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-465" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_african_kid.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="512"></p>
<p>And similarly to Bad Luck Brian, I would probably have a bitter end if I ever go to Black Friday shopping.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-464" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_most_interesting_man.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="627"></p>
<p>And if still somehow managed to get the last big deal item I would end up like Jack Sparrow (ok, actually that would be kind of cool)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-463" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_jack_sparrow.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"></p>
<p>And there will be trolls as usual, right? (I waited so much to use this meme)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-462" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_insanity_wolf.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>Also Black Friday is great opportunity to train your frugal muscles too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-461" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_advice_duck.jpg" alt="" width="537" height="390"></p>
<p>And finally, let&#8217;s keep one minute silence for the ones who work in stores today.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-460" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_leonidas.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="264"></p>
<p><em>Thats all for today folks. And prepare for your Black Friday. Coming soon.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you probably noticed I am trying to get inspiration from actual events/reads for these <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/funny-friday/">Funny Friday</a> posts. As it turned out you get a lot of different stimulus across the week, so finding a pattern or a theme can be hard sometimes. Honestly, I am thinking hard on dumping the themed editions idea and just fall back to a weekly roundup version. Anyway, what I am sure about that this Funny Friday series will change somehow in the future, just did not get to a decision yet.</p>
<p>Lately read about the positive or negative financial habits of some famous actors, like <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/07/johnny-depp-financial-crisis-money">Johnny Depp</a>, <a href="https://www.thefrugalgene.com/lifestyle-inflation/">Nicolas Cage</a> and Woody Harrelson (will add the link when I find it, I promise). Then I thought I will have a look at their net worths which lead me to <a href="https://www.therichest.com/top-lists/top-100-richest-actors/">this list</a>. It was obvious that I will not create a proper financial meme from all of them, but I chose some of my favorites. I hope you will like them.</p>
<h2>#6 Mel Gibson &#8211; $425M</h2>
<p>He had a lot of great acts, but probably Braveheart was the most memorable. I tried to bring a little bit of actuality for his words though.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-433" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_mel_gibson.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Mel-Gibson" width="413" height="478"></p>
<h2>#8 Sylvester Stallone &#8211; $400M</h2>
<p>Most of the people adore his action movies (cannot blame them, he is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_(film_series)">Rambo</a> after all), others prefer the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_(film_series)">Rocky series</a>. Maybe I am a weirdo, but for me his best movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102603/">Oscar</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-434" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_sylvester_stallone.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Sylvester-Stallone" width="620" height="465"></p>
<h2>#10 Tom Hanks &#8211; $350M</h2>
<p>I devour nearly everything what has a touch from him both as an actor or as a director. I am very picky about war themed movies, but&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185906/">Band of Brothers</a>&nbsp;is definitely one of my favorites and I cannot tell a single film which I was not able to watch having him as an actor.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-431" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_tom_hanks.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Tom-Hanks" width="400" height="270"></p>
<h2>#18 Leonardo DiCaprio &#8211; $245M</h2>
<p>Despite I pigeonholed him after Titanic I have to admit that almost all his movies are great and some of them like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264464/">Catch Me If You Can</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130884/">Shutter Island</a> are epic. Probably another contrarian opinion, but I was not able to watch the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/">Wolf of Wall Street</a>, after a while is started to become a big crying over rich people&#8217;s first world problems.&nbsp;<a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/why-arent-you-stealing-from-the-government/">This post</a> was also an inspiration for this meme, thanks <a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/">Mr. Groovy.</a></p>

<h2>#26 Johnny Depp &#8211; $200M</h2>
<p>You can love him or hate him (or blame him for his questionable money habits) he is a legend and his acting is genious. Deal with it.</p>

<p><em>I plan to keep updating this post in the future to include as many actors as I can from the list. You may ask, why? Well, because I like great movies (who don&#8217;t?) and the research was great fun. So keep an eye on this <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Have a Funny Friday!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&lt;offtopic&gt;This is not connecting to this Funny Friday episode, so you can skip it if you want. Earlier this week I wrote about my <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/who-killed-my-halloween/">relationship with Halloween</a> and that finally, I accepted it. Then it passed by without a single sign. This year I have seen no decorations, except in a supermarket. No kids in costumes wandering the streets and no one rang our bell for trick-or-treating. I was surprised and still don’t know why. Maybe never will.&lt;/offtopic&gt;</p>
<p>This week Sam over at Financial Samurai published a post with the title <a href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-stop-worrying-about-childs-future/">How To Stop Worrying About Your Child’s Future In This Competitive World</a>. I will not discuss the post in depth, go and read, worth the time. Also, I want to note that, despite the debate escalated about if he over-worries his son’s future, I agree with him in every detail. Maybe I am overstressing this topic too, but to be honest my whole journey into personal finance was kickstarted by the birth of my first daughter.</p>
<p>When I first held my daughter in my arms I realized that life will never be the same again and that now I have someone whom I will worry until the day I die. Four years later I have another one girl to worry about. And my mindset about stability and security changed entirely. This is a Funny Friday post, so I will not go into the details (keep them for a future post). Instead here are a handful of memes about the things popped into my mind about this topic. Don’t try to search for a storyline or any structure, this is an “off the top of my head” type of list.</p>
<h2>Negotiating</h2>
<p>Kids are extremely good in negotiating. Especially if it is about going to bed or eating another slice of chocolate. We should embrace this skill in them instead of suppressing it. What if they would be aware of their financial situation?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-408" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_negotiating.jpg" alt="Funny-Fiday-7-Negotiation" width="750" height="500"></p>
<h2>Practice what you preach</h2>
<p>Like it or not, we are role models to them at least in the early years. Don’t let the lack of interest or attention they keep an eye on your every single move and record everything. Knowing this it is extremely important to practice what you preach.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-407" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_loan.jpg" alt="Practice what you preach - Loan" width="500" height="902"></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-403" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_godfather.jpg" alt="Practice what you preach - Godfather" width="500" height="599"></p>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<p>You will be responsible for teaching the basic concepts of life, relationships, and finances to them properly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-405" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_concepts.jpg" alt="Basic concepts - FIRE" width="468" height="615"></p>
<h2>Careers</h2>
<p>While you should not force them to choose a career path you prefer, you should totally give them advice and try to protect them from stepping on the wrong path.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-406" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_career.jpg" alt="Career choice" width="494" height="688"></p>
<h2>Family business</h2>
<p>Creating a family business, teaching them valuable lessons and then when the time comes passing down the keys to them is an absolutely good thing in my opinion. My father is working in the family business which was started by my grandfather (imagine nothing fancy, there are two workers, he and my grandma). After working for others for 20+ years and got laid down in a very inappropriate way, this was the thing which made him able to provide a living for his family.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-401" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_takeover.jpg" alt="Family Business Takeover" width="526" height="394"></p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Taking the compound interest into account even this blog could develop into a valuable asset which I could leave as an inheritance to my children (or grandchildren). How cool would it be to hand down the site to them?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-402" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_get_a_job.jpg" alt="Get a real job!" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-404" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_retired.jpg" alt="Bitch please, I am retired!" width="500" height="332"></p>
<p><em>That’s all folks for today. Have a Funny Friday and tell me in the comments if you agree, don’t agree or don’t care. Also, the image sharing functionality added this week so you can share individual memes now.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week seemed a dizzy rush for me all along, spiced with depressing weather and sleep deprivation. I will not bore you with the details as this Friday is supposed to be another funny one, so let me just state it has something to do with kids, event planning, and work. Don’t know about you, but most of the times the most peaceful moments of the day are those when I browse through my Feedly list of posts to read with a hot mug of coffee before the family wakes up. Now I will try to share those moments from this week with you (in meme style of course).</p>
<p>To be honest, I really wanted to write a full Funny Friday style post about the event which made everyone excited this week, but I failed to do so. I came to the conclusion that like Warren Buffet does not invest into a business which he can not understand I should not write about a conference I have never attended. Saying that this week my status was like Spidey&#8217;s at the desk.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_6_spidey.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Spidey" width="469" height="359"></p>
<p>Like fellow bloggers who were celebrating this event with ice cream (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoFinCon4Me?src=hash">#NoFinCon4Me</a>) I was following the events only on Twitter. Two images caught my attention&#8230; so I turned them into memes. Hope you guys don&#8217;t mind it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_361" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-361" style="width: 818px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-361 size-full" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_6_pete_j.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Pete-J" width="818" height="500"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-361" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/">J Money</a> is questioning <a href="https://doyouevenblog.com/">Pete McPherson</a>&#8216;s blogging skills</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_362" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-362" style="width: 506px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-362 size-full" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_6_millennial_squad.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Millennial-Squad" width="506" height="500"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-362" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://distilleddollar.com/">Matt</a>, <a href="https://millennialmoneyman.com">Bobby</a> and <a href="https://millennialmoney.com/">Grant</a> probably discussing their courses</figcaption></figure>
<p>Apart from this let me give you some recommendations about what is worth reading from last weeks posts. Enjoy.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.bitchesgetriches.com/financial-advantages-white/">The Financial Advantages of Being White</a></h2>
<p>Last week I dedicated a whole Friday Fun episode to the idea of <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/funny-friday-disney-princess-edition/">Disney Princess Finances</a> inspired by Piggy from <a href="http://www.bitchesgetriches.com/">BitchesGetRiches</a>. This week I got impressed by Kitty&#8217;s insightful post about a very sensitive topic.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-368" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_6_skeptical_kid.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Skeptical-Kid" width="500" height="512"></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.notoriousdebt.com/best-way-pay-off-debt-champions-weigh-in/">WHAT’S THE BEST WAY TO PAY OFF DEBT?</a></h2>
<p>My another favorite girl in the PF blogging scene, Lindsay from <a href="https://www.notoriousdebt.com">NotoriousDEBT</a> published a post which reveals that recently she was busy interviewing 25 debt destroyers about their strategies. As we could be expecting from her she analyzed the answers, numbers, was drawing charts and drew the conclusions like a real professional scientist.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_6_overly_manly_man.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Overly-Manly-Man" width="500" height="500"></p>
<h2><a href="http://mymoneywizard.com/i-sort-of-bought-a-first-house/">I Bought a House! Sort of…</a></h2>
<p>Ok, now it&#8217;s the guy&#8217;s round. Sean over at <a href="http://mymoneywizard.com/">MyMoneyWizard</a>&nbsp;shared good news. He and his girlfriend joined the homeowners club. Congrats for them. Still, I have to admit that the reason why I decided to share this post with you is the good description of the method of his thinking and the smart calculations he made to get to the decision. I think we all can benefit from studying it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_6_house.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-House" width="500" height="609"></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.1500days.com/six-months-of-financial-independence-the-good-the-rad-and-the-ugly/">The Good, The Rad and The Ugly</a></h2>
<p>Our beloved <a href="https://www.1500days.com">Mr.1500</a> left the 6 months milestone of early retirement behind and wrote a post about his findings so far. This was not only interesting to me because provided a sneak peek behind the scenes of his early retirement schedule but confirmed me that the goal of reaching FIRE is a goal which worth fighting for.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-364" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_6_most_interesting_man.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Most-Interesting-Man" width="500" height="627"></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.keepthrifty.com/mini-retirement-vision/">THE MOST POWERFUL FACTOR FOR CREATING A MINI-RETIREMENT</a></h2>
<p>Yeah I know, I feature another coder here and yes I am biased. Deal with it. So Chris at <a href="https://www.keepthrifty.com">KeepThrifty</a>&nbsp;shared a very detailed description of how should you planning for a mini-retirement. Besides reaching FIRE this is kind of a more tempting (and more realistic) goal and I found this thinking process very useful.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-363" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_6_hannibal_smith.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Hannibal" width="384" height="279"></p>
<h2><a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/2017/10/23/people-are-predictably-irrational-a-nobel-memorial-prize-winning-theory/">People Are Predictably Irrational</a></h2>
<p>Last but not least I want to bring back the gender balance to parity. Liz from <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org">ChiefMomOfficer</a>&nbsp;kindly reminded us for the recent event of&nbsp;Nobel prize in Economics Is Awarded to Richard Thaler. And that his findings are highly related to&nbsp;(or influence?) our PF blogging topics. I think she put a new title on my reading to-do list.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-365" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_6_it_was_a_lie.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Lie" width="381" height="378"></p>
<p>That’s all for today. Hope you liked it and I you will benefit from reading the aforementioned articles. For all of you FinCon dwelling lucky ones: &#8220;Have a great time and let your Friday be funny too!&#8221;.</p>
