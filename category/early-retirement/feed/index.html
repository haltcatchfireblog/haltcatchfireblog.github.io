Enjoy!</p>
<h3>Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p>Hello. I’m a blogger who primarily blogs about personal finance. My website is Freedom Is Groovy. My wife and I started the blog in August of 2015 and we go by the monikers Mrs. Groovy and Mr. Groovy, respectively. We haven’t revealed our true identities in order to maintain a bit of privacy.</p>
<h3>Tell us a nerdy secret if you have one</h3>
<p>I’m 57 years old and I’m still intrigued by math. I have a Khan Academy login and I try to do one or two math problems a day. If Mrs.G. would let me, I’d like to take our country’s leading standardized test for college admission again, the SAT.</p>
<h3>When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p>I was in college in the early 80s and my housemate was an engineering student who actually had a personal computer (very rare back then). I don’t know exactly what he did with his PC. It and the software that came with it was very crude. All I know is that he would use his PC to connect to our school’s engineering department over the phone line and our house phone would be out of commission for hours.</p>
<h3>What was your first machine?</h3>
<p>My first PC an Epson (yes, the company primarily known for printers used to make PCs). I bought it in 1986 or 1987, and the hard drive was only 20 megabytes. I couldn’t afford the 40-megabyte hard drive model. Oh, and I bought my first PC because I wanted to write a book.</p>
<h3>Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p>I jumped straight into programming. I worked in a highway department and all the roads we maintained were cataloged in a Word document (we called it the “street dictionary”). Anyway, for a number of reasons I won’t detail here, cataloging our roads in a Word document wasn’t very practical. So I took it upon myself to manual type all the information from our street dictionary into an Access database. Learning Access databases led me to VBA and SQL, and VBA and SQL let me to C++.</p>
<h3>What about education, was it related to computing, did you learn in a traditional way or something else?</h3>
<p>I studied sociology, journalism, and public administration&#8211;nothing related to computers and programming. I got the database and programming bug in the mid-90s and I’m entirely self-taught. Back then I would just buy one database or programming book at a time and just plow through it.</p>
<h3>What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p>I have a BA in sociology, a BS in journalism, and an MPA in public administration.</p>
<h3>When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</h3>
<p>I got my first real job in 1986. As already mentioned before, it was with a highway department on Long Island, New York. I started off as a clerk in the personnel department and eventually got promoted to a construction inspector after passing a civil service exam. About three years into my construction inspector career, I was put in charge of rating all the roads we maintained. Part of this new assignment also meant maintaining the street dictionary I mentioned earlier, and the street dictionary proved to be the impetus of my IT career.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I was the highway department’s IT for over ten years but my titled never changed from a construction inspector. My highway department didn’t have any computer or programming related job titles at the time.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Groovy and I left Long Island in 2006 and relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina, I got my first IT job with an actual IT title. I was a data analyst for a healthcare consultant and I mainly did what I did for the highway department&#8211;create and manage databases and write code.</p>
<h3>What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p>I only worked formally in the IT sector for ten years. And I only worked for one company during that ten year period. And what pleasantly surprised me about this company was that it wasn’t a slave to formal credentials. Most of the IT people in this company had computer science degrees. But at least a third didn’t. All this company cared about were skills. If you had the skills, you would be hired and promoted. It didn’t matter whether you learned those skills in college or on your own. And just for the record, there were four guys at this company that I really looked up to. Their programming skills were off the charts. Two had computer science degrees and two were self-taught.</p>
<h3>What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</h3>
<p>I am currently retired. Mrs. Groovy and I achieved financial independence in 2014 but didn’t retire until October of 2016. We wanted to make sure we entered retirement with a nice cushion.</p>
<h3>Tell us about your journey so far?</h3>
<p>For Mrs. Groovy and me, the key to achieving financial independence was getting out of debt and owning our home outright. Once you have shed the mortgage, the car loan, and the credit card debt, the cost of living is remarkably cheap, especially in the southern portion of the United States. When we became completely debt free and owned our home outright in 2006, we were able to save over half of our gross household income. Save over half of your gross household income for ten years and you’ll have a good chance of achieving financial independence&#8211;providing the stock market doesn’t frown on you, of course. Another key was finding contentment in the ordinary. If you need fancy cars, clothes, electronics, and vacations to secure happiness, you’ll have a very difficult time-saving money and achieving financial independence. Don&#8217;t’ get me wrong. Mrs. Groovy and I appreciate fabulous stuff just like everyone else. In fact, we’re spending five weeks in Australia later this year. But we get just as much joy out of playing cards with family and friends or going out for ice cream on a Saturday night, or reading a good book. Master the art of being happy with less and life will get incredibly easy.</p>
<h3>How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</h3>
<p>Being an IT guy primarily affected my finances by making me a coveted employee. Once I developed top-notch database skills, I had no problem securing employment, promotions, and bonuses. For instance, at my last job, I started off as a data analyst. Then I was promoted to program specialist, and soon after that, I was promoted to program manager. And all because I had a knack for manipulating data, automating tasks, and writing complex SQL.</p>
<h3>Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p>Yes. And it doesn’t take much to see if you have an aptitude for IT field. If you’re a cubicle jockey who primarily answers phone calls and performs data entry, start teaching yourself Excel and Access. And after three months or so of learning the basics of spreadsheets and databases, start trying to automate aspects of your job with Excel, Access, and VBA. It’s a great way to learn something on your boss’s dime and make your job easier. Also, it’s a great way to advance your career. Become good at automating routine office tasks and you will become a very valuable employee.</p>
<h3>Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p>Hell no! My biggest regret is that I didn’t discover databases and programming sooner.</p>
<h3>Tips for beginners?</h3>
<p>Start. Download Notepad++ and start coding with Javascript. Go to the W3School and the Khan Academy and start working through the Javascript tutorials. Once you get comfortable with Javascript, move on to PHP or Python. Finally, you should become familiar with databases and SQL. Backend databases hold the world’s data and once you can communicate with databases via SQL, you have all the world’s data at your fingertips. Very powerful. Download the latest express edition of SQL Server from Microsoft and start honing your SQL skills (the express version is free).</p>
<h3>Which technology area picks your brain most these days?</h3>
<p>I’m out of the IT business these days. I mainly occupy my brain by reading and writing about personal finance. Before I left the workforce in 2016, I was very intrigued by No SQL databases. No SQL databases store data in free-flowing tables. One row might have ten columns and the next row might have twenty columns. Apparently, this kind of storage works better with massive amounts of data than regular SQL databases. You can retrieve your data faster. Anyway, during the last year or so of my career, I started playing around with Mongo, an opensource No SQL database. So if I were still in the IT game today, I would be honing my No SQL skills.</p>
<h3>What do you think is the biggest improvement/challenge the IT industry looking forward these days?</h3>
<p>Today, it’s much easier to teach yourself and prove to potential employers that you have the requisite skills. And you don’t have to be rich to go the DIY route. When I got interested in databases and coding in the 90s, there was no opensource software, no YouTube, no Khan Academy, no GitHub, no high-speed internet, and no blogosphere. I imagine there were some certifications back then, but I don’t recall any. If people wanted to get a worthwhile IT credential, they had to go to college.</p>
<h3>We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</h3>
<p>• Desktop OS: Windows 10<br />
• Mobile OS: Android<br />
• Machine: HP<br />
• Browser: Chrome<br />
• Programming language: SQL (I know. Not really a language, but I’m an SQL junkie.)<br />
• And the most important… spaces or tabs: Tabs</p>
<h3>Would you write a couple of lines of code to present a simple financial principle?</h3>
<pre>Dim curMonthlyExpenses as currency
Dim curMonthlyTakeHomePay as currency
Dim sSQL as string

curMonthlyTakeHomePay = $6000

sSQL = “Select Sum(Amount) From ExpenseLogTable Where Month(ExpenseDate) = 4;”

curMonthlyExpenses = GetMonthlyExpenses(sSQL)

If curMonthlyTakeHomePay - curMonthlyExpenses &gt; 0
    DepositMoneyIntoBrokerageAccount(curMonthlyTakeHomePay - curMonthlyExpenses)
Else
    MsgBox (“You’re spending too much!”)</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, groovy freedomist, that’s all I got. What say you? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><i>Welcome back geeky FIRE seekers. A long time has passed since the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/coders-of-finance-ms-ziyou/">last episode</a> of this series. Some folks even asked me if it is over. The truth is that this series takes place in a special corner of my heart and I don&#8217;t really plan on killing it before I stop blogging, so please calm down.&nbsp;</i>Today I brought you another fellow European and London based blogger who shied away so far from talking about the topic of programming in detail on his blog, however, he is one with the most advanced programming skills amongst us. </em><em>Enjoy!</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Greetings to all my imaginary friends on the internet! I am the man behind the pseudonym { in·deed·a·bly }, who publishes random thoughts at <a href="https://indeedably.com">indeedably.com</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us a nerdy secret if you have one</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I wrote the original real-time SMS vote counting algorithm used by several reality television shows.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some enterprising guys on my team monitored the incoming results, then dashed down to the bookmakers just before voting closed to bet on the outcome.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They didn’t win, learning an expensive lesson that reality television shows are scripted!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I was about 7 years old, my father came home carrying an enormous box containing a computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He plugged it into the television and powered it up, then sat there staring expectantly at the blinking cursor with a puzzled expression on his face… waiting for something to happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It quickly became apparent he had absolutely no idea what to do next!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The following day he bought a copy of a computer magazine called Zap from the local newsagent. It came with an insert containing the code listing for a game called Aztec Challenge.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1220 size-full" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ActecChallenge_Animation.gif" alt="ActecChallenge" width="384" height="272"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This was years before the World Wide Web was a glimmer in Tim Berners-Lee’s eye. Back then if you wanted to play a game, you first had to type in the source code!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My father valiantly tried to key in the pages of incomprehensible hexadecimal source code. He quickly became frustrated, deciding that his sausage fingers weren’t designed for “computering”. He parked me in front of the keyboard and proceeded to dictate the source code, giving me a clip over the ear each time the checksum validator beeped an objection to my dubious two finger typing skills.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fortunately, this too quickly became boring. My father stormed out to the shed to play with toys that he did understand&#8230; power tools! I don’t recall him ever attempting to use that computer again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Labouriously I keyed in the remainder of the source code. It took hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Eventually, it was done, and I was able to run the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was magical! From that moment onwards I was hooked on computers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What was your first machine?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A Commodore 64, with a cassette player and a joystick.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1221 size-full" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Commodore_64_with_the_external_power_supply_and_Commodore_1530_C2N_Datasette.jpg" alt="Commodore 64" width="800" height="401"></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I quickly became more interested in learning how they worked rather than playing them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I wanted to peek behind the curtain at the code that was executing while a program was running.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To translate the magic into science.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To learn how programs actually performed whatever function they were executing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before long I had taught myself to program in BASIC. Soon I was modifying games to make them better. Eventually, I started writing games of my own.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What about education, was it related to computing, did you learn in a traditional way or something else? What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Near the end of high school, the school I attended acquired a dozen battered old IBM XT clones. They announced they would offer a computing course, re-badged themselves a “technology” school, and begged the local government for additional funding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A very angry English teacher was given the thankless task of trying to teach a bunch of disinterested teenagers how to code. He must have really upset the school principal to be given that assignment!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the first lesson, it quickly became apparent the teacher had never before used a computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By the end of the second lesson, the other students were asking me for assistance debugging their simple “Hello World” programs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Halfway through the third lesson, the teacher gave up and tasked me with running the class.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For the remainder of the school year, I taught the class how to code their own “choose your own adventure” style quest game (including graphics and sound).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The teacher contentedly sat in the corner reading novels by Douglas Adams and Grant Naylor, randomly bursting into thunderous belly laughs that shook the windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At university, I studied Accounting. I took a couple of elective computing classes early on but quickly concluded the impractical way universities teach computing wouldn’t help me get a job.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">My first job was delivering newspapers, aged 10.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I took a second job working in a photo lab, aged 16.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I added a third job working in a bar, aged 18.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My first professional job was as an Accountant, aged 20.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Accounting was great. It paid well! More importantly, it taught me to understand the profit motive and how to identify the value chain. These are valuable life skills that everyone should possess.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Accounting also involved no heavy lifting, working outdoors in the rain, breaking up drunken fights, or developing the random (often bizarre, and occasionally disturbing) photos that people take!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Aged 21, I followed a pretty girl to the United Kingdom on a working holiday visa. There I fell into a freelance developer <a href="https://indeedably.com/fear/">contract</a>, and have been involved in IT ever since.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the beginning, I loved the beauty of an elegantly coded algorithm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In those days memory, storage, and CPU cycles were expensive precious commodities. I learned that program efficiency was paramount, and performance tuning was a superpower.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In time I realized that it really didn’t matter how fast or pretty my code was if the specification I was working to failed to solve the client’s business problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I moved upstream, into analysis and requirements capture.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It turned out that clients often ask for the wrong thing. In these cases, regardless of how faithfully my requirements document captured their request, the resulting solution would solve exactly the wrong problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I moved upstream again, into architecture and later management consulting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now I got involved right at the start, helping clients to differentiate between what they think they want and what they actually need.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This typically involves identifying the strategic goals the client hopes to achieve, then (providing the goal makes sense) determining the optimal way to make it happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">More often than, what is required are people and process focussed changes, that no amount of technical wizardry could ever hope to rectify!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also learned that data is the true lifeblood of an organization, far more important than any individual process or piece of code.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lose or leak too much of it, and the business dies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Corrupt it, and the business experiences a long lingering death from badly informed decision making.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Data lasts forever. It will outlive any of the ever-changing array of transient applications, pipelines and data stores through which it may travel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look after your data as if your life depends on it… because in your business’s case, it really does!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am very fortunate, in that I have passed the point of having “enough”.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us about your journey so far?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over the years I have established a diversified set of sustainable <a href="https://indeedably.com/i-own/">passive income streams</a> that now cover the majority of my living expenses.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Several years ago I struck a balance between living for today and planning for tomorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I lead a semi-retired working pattern. During the cold wet London winter months, I usually help clients solve interesting tricky problems. The remainder of the year I enjoy being a man of leisure.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Information Technology provides a wealth of opportunities for those who are willing to take them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">IT remains one of the few remaining professions where there are low barriers to entry, and what you can do matters far more than where you went to school or who you know.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Working initially as a freelancer, and then later running a consultancy, allowed me to dictate the pace of my career progression. I could also charge whatever a client was willing to pay for my time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The flip side of that equation is that every day is a performance evaluation: do well today and you may be welcome back tomorrow. Do poorly and you will quickly find yourself seeking a new client. Competitive pressures and commercial uncertainties are constant threats to your livelihood.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Everyone should learn the basics of coding: algorithm design, control of flow, and decision statements. These are core competencies, similar to having a basic grasp of reading or maths.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, I think people should carefully consider what they desire from life, and where they want to live before they pursue a career as a programmer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are amazingly gifted programmers sat all over the world, each capable of writing beautifully elegant and wonderfully efficient code.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many of them won’t need to earn as much as you to pay their rent.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the quality of output is materially the same, the main differentiator becomes price.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In a race to the bottom, those living in high cost of living locations get priced out of the market first.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The technology game is also brutally Darwinian. Technology trends change at an alarming rate. Hard-won skills and experience can become stale or irrelevant after a dishearteningly short period of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Re-skilling every 2-3 years just to remain employable is not uncommon for programmers. The novelty wears off that particular aspect of coding very quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My recommendation for people interested in a career in technology would be to focus on client-facing roles that cannot be easily outsourced or offshored. Roles that require both business and technology knowledge. These types of roles are also harder to replace with AI.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">When your hobby becomes your job, it quickly starts to feel like work rather than fun!<br />
Once I started coding for a living, I quickly lost all interest in tinkering with personal projects.<br />
That was unfortunate, as previously much of my free time had been devoted to torturing computers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tips for beginners?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Learn coding basics by completing some free/low-cost online courses offered by sites like <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://www.lynda.com/">Lynda.com</a>, and <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Becoming proficient at coding is like becoming proficient at music. Initially, you will be unspeakably bad. With time and a lot of practice, you will improve.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Identify an actual, tangible, problem you are personally experiencing. Now code yourself a solution. And repeat.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Vendor certifications are often an expensive waste of time and money.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you want to pursue a university degree then carefully consider the value of each institution’s brand. Perform an honest cost/benefit analysis on whether the tuition fees are actually worth having that brand on your degree or diploma.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example, the internationally renowned Oxford University and the largely unknown Oxford Brookes University share many student facilities and charge identical tuition fees. Yet one is far more likely to get you a job interview than the other.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Which technology area picks your brain most these days?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BostonDynamics/videos">work Boston Dynamics</a> are doing with robotics is fascinating.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What do you think is the biggest improvement/challenge the IT industry looking forward these days?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are several, but one of the big ones is managing “legacy hell”.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Recent ransomware attacks highlighted the huge number of organizations that depend upon technology platforms long past their useful life. It was alarming to see how much of the economy was held together by nothing more than duct tape and hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Decades of underfunding, shortsighted management decisions, and the absence of sustainable IT strategies have created a major vulnerability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The problem has existed for a long time. The core systems found at the heart of many major institutions still run on 1970s technology, written in arcane languages where the majority of skilled practitioners have long since retired or died of old age.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately, we keep repeating those same mistakes. For example, consider the vast numbers of web-enabled “Internet of Things” devices that ship with no viable means of patching security vulnerabilities.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">You’re still fighting the last war!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Worry about something you can control, like how you will pay the bills once AI begins to program themselves. The majority of programmers become structurally redundant at that point.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><em>Desktop OS:</em> macOS</li>
<li><em>Mobile OS:</em> iOS</li>
<li><em>Machine:</em> Xbox</li>
<li><em>Browser:</em> Chrome</li>
<li><em>Programming language:</em> Visual Basic for Applications… there is nothing Excel can’t do, but an awful lot that it shouldn’t!</li>
<li><em>And the most important… spaces or tabs:</em> gofmt and auto-fixing linters solved this</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Would you write a couple of lines of code to present a simple financial principle?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I would love to… but no.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Years ago my developers staged a mutiny and revoked my access to the tools.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is possible they were intimidated by the sheer awesomeness of the boss’s coding skills…. but unlikely!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They protested that when I was having fun crafting code, I wasn’t doing my day job: lining up new client projects, managing stakeholders, designing high-level solutions, and generally keeping them all gainfully employed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They were probably right. Identifying, and then focusing on, those unique things we can each do to sustainably add value is a sound financial operating principle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are already done with the triduum of <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/who-killed-my-halloween/">Halloween, All Saints&#8217; Day and All Souls’ Day</a>. While the Halloween part got more and more popularity at our ends only in recent years the other two days were always the occasion for us to visit the graves of our loved ones. This melancholic time of the year is perfect for remembering and reflection. As the weather turns colder, the days darker, and nature slowly slips into its hibernated state our thoughts unintentionally shifts towards passing away and dying.</p>
<p>Death is a scary thing and we instinctively try to avoid even thinking about that. At least for most of us. I don’t know what has changed lately, maybe this comes with age (or maybe, as I hope, wisdom) but I am no more in that camp. I got used to thinking about death and in a strange way it calms me. Accepting that it is the law of nature, that all living things will unavoidably die at some point, in a strange way, provides me with a peace of mind. Just as thinking about the many different ways this could happen.</p>
<p>Maybe it is just the logical thinker in me but it calms me the same way as knowing that I have handled all the possible outcomes while writing computer code. While life is much more complicated than the average software it does not hurt if we build into our program a proper way of error handling. Trust me it is a very shitty thing when while running a program something goes south and when you are debugging the code and find the error all you see is a long forgotten comment /* TODO &#8211; error handling */. This is not something you want to leave as a legacy for your loved ones once the source code of your body throws an exception and enters into an infinite loop of noop().</p>
<p>Apologies, I went a little bit too nerdy, it happens every now and then. What I wanted to say is that despite it could be uncomfortable and scary, thinking about the inevitable and preparing for it properly is a must do for all of us (especially financially). Let’s face with those scenarios and draw at least a sketchy plan for handling them.</p>
<p>So what if you would die…</p>
<h2>Today</h2>
<p>Ok, now you may ask why do we start with the worst case scenario? Well, because in chronological order this is the first possible option (and maybe you will understand that this is not the worst case after all). Also this the most important scenario to prepare for especially if you leave behind some humans who are count on you. As <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/things-that-are-scarier-than-halloween/#comment-272623">someone pointed out recently</a>, financial dependence is a scary thing (yes, even more than clowns). If you are one of the two or the only breadwinner in the family, like myself, you should not understate this situation. Just ask yourself, if you would stop breathing right after you finish this sentence will your loved ones be covered and set financially to get through the unimaginably hard task of moving on with their lives?</p>
<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Put the time and effort into learning about your insurance options and shop for proper insurance applicable for your situation (term life, salary, etc… but no whole life, at least for me)!</p></blockquote>
<p>This is something I keep asking myself lately and the answer still disturbs me. Three years ago when this question started to pop up (alongside with the curiosity about retirement funding and investments) the answer came in the form of an insurance agent. One consultation and some signatures later I became the responsible, proud, and smart owner of a “whole&#8221; life policy. I was convinced that this is the financial holy grail as it not just provides you with life insurance but also accumulates “investments” and will pay you back every cent plus a “healthy&#8221; profit if you survive the contracted 30 years. I was happy with that for a while but then discovered the personal finance blogosphere and everything changed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1180" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/not_today-1.jpg" alt="Not today" width="500" height="281"></p>
<p>Now I understand how naive I was and what is the price I paid for it. So I did what anyone else would do in my situation, procrastinated the decision for another year. But as we are getting closer to the next payment of the annual premium, I finally forced myself to review this thing, put the numbers on paper and make a responsible decision. So I put together a spreadsheet with all the info, tailored some formulas and drew the lessons from the numbers.</p>
<p>Long story short, the conclusion was that as an investment it performs awfully and as an insurance, it is pretty expensive compared to the coverage it provides. I had no clue about planning for the future and possible investment vehicles back then. According to the numbers, the best case scenario where I survive the contract and get a payout the accumulated amount would be damaged by roughly 50% erosion in buying power. Also if meanwhile shit would hit the fan the payout would barely cover two years of expenses for my family left without a breadwinner&#8230; forever.</p>
<p>So, now I am shopping for a proper term life insurance and about to break that previous contract. It will mean that I will lose the first two years premium but still less than what I would lose if I keep at paying through the thirty year period. In terms of investments, I also will take the control into my hand <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> An expensive lesson but definitely an important one.</p>
<h2>Soon</h2>
<p>See, I told you that maybe today is not the worst possible scenario. I would not go into the details how would it be possible, let&#8217;s just assume you have a crystal ball and you know for sure that you have a couple of months/years left until a specific date when you will kick the bucket with a 100% confidence. Having the insurance topic, mentioned in the previous paragraphs, already handled what should you do in such a situation?</p>
<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Put your efforts into fixing anything you can and into leaving an intellectual and financial legacy which will remain here as a guide for the future!</p></blockquote>
<p>If I have learned something from such real life and fictional (books, movies) situations it is that after you accept the inevitable (finally) and the initial panic will flush away you will get a brutal clarity about what is important to you in life and what is not. Personally, I have never been in such a situation and I hope that I never will but I assume my focus would narrow around my family and their future.</p>
<p>We had a discussion about this with J$ and we agreed that both of us would start to write letters to our loved ones about our thoughts on any situation we think it would be important to the person to hear them. A letter for my daughters to help them get over the first love-sorrow or to express how proud I am at a future success moment. Another for my wife to remind herself the happy moments on nights when she feels so lonely without me. I think writing these would be a time well spent. I would spend as much time with them as I can and write these letters while they are sleeping (“<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431308/">PS I love you</a>” style).</p>
<p>On the financial field, your best guess should not be any less. Try to figure out how could you ensure their financial stability in the future. Also, you should not only create a plan and put it into work, but you also have to teach them how to maintain the system and keep it running when you won’t be there. Moreover, you could leave references and point them towards the sources you were inspired and instructed by. And last but not least encourage them to not only take your words blindly but do their own research, understand the principles, build upon them and get even better than you ever were. After all, this is what we all wish to our kids, aren’t we?</p>
<h2>On time</h2>
<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Reach FIRE asap to free your time</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an ambiguous description but you will get it when you read further. By &#8220;on time&#8221; I mean in case your life goes on like the average and your final hour come around the expected age of yours. How could you know when will it be? If you Google it, you can find out that the current life expectancy is 76 for man and 81 for women. My reaction when I read about a new actual number somewhere always was “hurray, we are living longer again&#8221;. Only recently found out that it only applies to someone who borns now and we have to search for our stats a little bit differently.</p>
<p>You can find a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html">table here</a> where you can look up your numbers or if you prefer <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/population/longevity.html">calculators here</a> is one for the same purpose. It tells me that as a 34 years old male I could expect living another 48 years and my target year could be around 82. I am kind of comfortable with this estimation, I have seen some fellas with that age and it seemed to me that they were pretty satisfied with their lives and what they have achieved.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1185 size-full" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/old_couple-e1541139119669.jpg" alt="Old couple" width="500" height="466"></p>
<p>By that time you should have applied the insurance advice from the &#8220;Today&#8221; part through the past years and maybe you did the exercises from the “Soon” part, even if it did not happen. This option is when our beloved FIRE community enters the big picture, as this is the scenario where your main focus should be reaching FIRE asap. The sooner you get there the more years will you have left for doing whatever your heart desires. Maybe I am biased on this topic and I accept that this is not the only way of living a successful life but I honestly think that this should be the basic goal for everyone.</p>
<h2>Much later</h2>
<p>There is another factor what we did not take into account in the previous scenario. According to the historical life expectancy numbers, we can observe an annual rise in the expected age by 0.2 years. This addition alone would add 9.6 years to my 82 years expectation, but there is more. This rise is caused by the improving standards of living for the population alongside with the development of medicine and science. And because of the huge amount of resources and effort channeling into these fields, it is very likely that even this rise will accelerate in the future. Besides these improvements, humans started to become more conscious about their health and the environment. We still have a long way to go on these fields but this can also boost that acceleration as many top death causes are connected with our own bad habits or pollution in general.</p>
<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Go for the hardcore FI way and NTYP</p></blockquote>
<p>What impressed me is that if you make a little bit of research you can find hundreds of ideas of the possibilities here about future life expectancy, ranging from 100 to over 200 years. Please note that many of these estimations are not originating from some science fiction movies but from legit scientists. If you think of it how many things became a reality for today which was pretty wild dreams in the last century, and even some folks were burned for such ideas a couple of centuries earlier, these numbers aren’t that insane. In my opinion, this is a possible future scenario for the humankind and I hope that this will actually happen.</p>
<p>Same time, despite the benefits of prolonged lifespans, a whole new variety of problems will arise. First of all, I am pretty sure there will be a huge debate if the whole process is morally right or not. Prolonging our lives beyond the natural range isn’t the phenomenon we call &#8220;playing God”? Or this is just the next step of the evolution of the humankind and this possibility always was there encoded into our DNA just the circumstances weren’t optimal? The answers for these questions will come from smarter folks than me. Also, the increased population will have huge requirements of resources but I hope that amongst the increased number of humans there will be even more geniuses living a much longer life to reach breakthroughs and they will solve these problems.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1197" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dr_evil.jpg" alt="Dr Evil" width="500" height="405"></p>
<p>Last but not least there is the question our financially nerdy minds would ask, how will this affect the economy, the financial system, and our beloved personal finances. Today the 4% rule is the gold standard but some folks are already more conservative with withdrawal rates. Some even say that a longer life is a big threat for a happily funded retirement but this is a problem everyone would welcome I think. So what if we start from today&#8217;s principles but we have to plan not for only a couple of decades of retirement but a century or more? I think that the definite goal, in this case, would be reaching the ideal withdrawal rate via the “Never Touch Your Principal” method. Sam wrote a good article about calculating that number <a href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/the-ideal-withdrawal-rate-for-retirement-doesnt-touch-principal/">at Financial Samurai</a>, according to his reasoning you should aim for 2.2-2.8% WR. This would change our worshipped 25x number to 40-50x in terms of nest egg accumulation. The good news is that with a prolonged life you will potentially have much more time for that accumulation phase.</p>
<p>Maybe Suze Orman has some oracle-like skills and that’s why she is echoing the 70 years barrier? By our current numbers the traditional retirement age is at two-thirds of a person&#8217;s life, early retirement age is somewhere under that but at least at the one-third mark. So if we extrapolate that to a prolonged life (and assuming that aging will slow down accordingly) when life expectancy will hit 210 years the old school retirement age would reach 140 years of age. It would be really funny to see them joking on future FIREfolks.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So here you have it, my complete life-ending scenario list. This is the first time I walked through even myself on all possibilities chronologically. It even surprised me how different our focus should be in the different scenarios. So if you want to have a bulletproof plan for the future start with preparing for “Today”, then put some thoughts into the “Soon”, set your goal according to “On time” and try to improve that towards the “Much later” case. Start today and if this article helped you secure your financial future buy me a $60 beer sometime in the next century. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><em>What about you? Which scenario is the scariest in your opinion? Which is the most probable? Which is the one you are actually preparing for? Did I miss something? Am I crazy? Will AI have an intelligence explosion by 2060 and erase humanity from the surface of the Blue Planet once and for all? Let me know in the comments and let&#8217;s have a conversation until the end of the time!</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Seven years have passed since Pete Adeney alias Mr. Money Mustache started his blog and Mustachianism was born.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven years have passed since Pete Adeney alias <a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/04/06/meet-mr-money-mustache/">Mr. Money Mustache</a> started his blog and Mustachianism was born. He was not the one who started the FIRE movement itself but definitely brought the idea to more people than anyone before. The <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/the-history-of-fier/">roots of the concept of FIRE</a> are older than many of us imagine. It is not a new invention, but only the recent years brought higher popularity and broader media coverage. Like all other great movements, it also had its enemies. Naysayers,&nbsp;complainypantses, and trolls were everywhere. They are still out there but there are followers at equally huge numbers. And as the world changes our numbers are increasing.</p>
<p>The circumstances, the world order we are living in made necessary for most of us to start searching for answers. Basically, it pushes us into a financial awakening. At least the ones who are NOT willing to become/remain slaves of the system (at least not for many long decades). The ones who have open minds and constantly searching for the opportunity to become a better version of themselves and optimize their (and their loved ones) situation as much as they can. These everyday heroes are walking amongst us and I honestly think that they will make this world a better place.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s play with FIRE</h2>
<p>As someone who is a big fan of low information diet, I wasn&#8217;t aware of how mainstream media presents this phenomenon to the masses. Then the other day I read <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/2018/10/01/damaging-the-movement-i-love-the-problem-with-fire-stereotypes-and-the-mainstream-media/">this article from Liz</a> over at ChiefMomOfficer.com. It seems media still want to alienate people from the idea that they have a choice. That they have many options and many paths which they could follow. Then I get to know from the <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/travis-shakespeare-interview/">Mad Fientist that a documentary</a> is on its way to introduce the concept of FIRE to the people. Can&#8217;t wait watching it and to see the effect.</p>

<h2>Don&#8217;t let FIRE rest in peace</h2>
<p>Same time it seems that even oceans of water cannot stop the spreading of FIRE. On the other side of the pond, here in our beloved Europe, the warriors of FIRE started to gather under the flag of <a href="https://retireinprogress.com/european-early-retirement-guide-a-call-to-action/">Mr.RIP to bring the European Codex of FIRE</a> into existence. We are joining our forces to gather all the information from all corners of the continent which could help anyone to improve his/her financial situation and kick off the journey towards a happier life packed with freedom and joy. It will require a huge amount of work but we will do our best to make it happen. As they say,&nbsp;“nothing worth having comes easy”.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1105 aligncenter" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/book-1740515_640.png" alt="Book" width="300" height="200"></p>
<h2>Nadir</h2>
<p>And finally, after becoming so energized and optimistic by these news, the internet (ok, maybe not the whole internet but our corner definitely) was blown up by <a href="http://podcast.affordanything.com/153-hate-fire-movement-suze-orman/">Paula Pants latest podcast episode</a> in which she interviewed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suze_Orman">Suze Orman</a> about her thoughts on the FIRE movement. It turned out that she <strong>hates it</strong>. She hates it, hates it, hates it. If somehow you did not hear it and you don&#8217;t believe me check out the episode yourself.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I got pissed off. I am not that kind of people who spend their time engaging in catfights in the virtual space but this time I felt the urge to jump into the pit. I even shared the <a href="https://twitter.com/_HaltCatchFire/status/1047387150814203904">link on Twitter</a> and added a very &#8220;clever&#8221; and &#8220;funny&#8221; comment, saying <em>&#8220;Suze is totally right. If you are a person who understands the FIRE concepts as good as she does it would be the worst idea to pursuing FIRE&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1111" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2jbmxo.jpg" alt="castaway" width="444" height="311"></p>
<p>Shame on me, the truth is that before I was listening to this episode I had no clue about who is Suze Orman. I heard her name a few times but was not even aware that she has anything to do with finance. I thought she is just another celebrity whose opinion is important to the brainwashed masses. Then I realized that if I would follow this path I could end up hate talking about a person whom I know nothing about.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Exactly as she did with the FIRE movement.</em></p>
<h2>FIRE in my eyes</h2>
<p>For anyone who is familiar with the concept, it was shining through the interview that she knows the world and its financial problems very well but she doesn&#8217;t get the concept in its wholeness. Thus I keeping myself to my tweet. Any Average Joe who only understands that reaching FIRE is a three-step process (work hard, save and invest, create a portfolio of one million dollars or 25x annual expenses and you are done) should not jump into FIRE with both feet because he will &#8220;burn alive&#8221; (at least he died trying).</p>
<p>FIRE is not a one-size-fits-all recipe and comes in many flavors. It is as unique as we are. There is a big chance that my path and my journey will be very different from anyone else&#8217;s. Even for a single person, there are many paths which could potentially lead to their goal. Following the FIRE movement does not mean that you are joining a flock marching towards the same destination. It is about mastering the tools and concepts which helps you analyze the world you are living, examining your current situation, designing a better version of your reality, and putting together a plan to get there.</p>
<h2>So who is Suze Orman after all?</h2>
<p>As I am part of the FIRE scene only for a couple of years so far (mostly those years when she was in &#8220;early&#8221; retirement) and didn&#8217;t know much about her I did what anyone does when trying to find out something. Entered her name into Google and went to Wikipedia for the info. I will not echo here her life story but have to admit that what she achieved is pretty impressing. Writing and publishing ten books is a huge achievement alone. Successfully selling an idea for thousands of people is also a great achievement.</p>
<p><strong>So what could we learn from Suze? Honestly, a lot.</strong> As someone who is walking on this earth for a long time and spent a significant part of that in the financial industry probably knows more about finances than many of us. Even the list of the potential risks she brought up in the interview is very legit. The problem was (as Paula summarized pretty good at the end of the episode) that she missed the point that the concept of FIRE contains the principle that you should include the handling of these risks in your master plan. You should be prepared for them. Even for the almost post-apocalyptic, AI-driven&nbsp;dark future, she painted so colorfully. If you don&#8217;t know where to <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/prepping-for-non-preppers-101/">start prepping</a> let me help you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1122" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/noah.jpg" alt="Noah" width="500" height="476"></p>
<h2>So why is she wrong?</h2>
<p>I checked many comments in various comment sections and amongst the many many valid ones found the most appealing to me. There was one saying that she totally lost her connection with reality. Well, it is true and false at the same time. She lost her connection to OUR reality as hers is totally different. As I mentioned above, FIRE comes in many different flavors. Let&#8217;s pull out your spreadsheets about your NUMBER. Then find out how much does it cost to own a villa on a private island and change your housing costs to that. Replace your commute expenses with the cost of operating a private jet. Estimate a grocery budget of hers. If you do this all there is a chance that her NUMBER is much higher than the average folk&#8217;s and the 25x result probably will end up in those decamillions. But in the land of frugality, it just does not work like that.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1124" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2jevra.jpg" alt="Back in my day" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>She designed a very luxurious lifestyle for herself and probably for her well of clients also. But this does not represent the average FIRE seeker. We are a very inhomogenous bunch of people. Some of us earn seven-figure incomes but some of us only lower five-digits. There are single folks, families, old and young people and all kind of humans from all possible genders, races,&nbsp;and religions. But these variables are all irrelevant. What determines your ability of reaching FIRE is your willingness to improve yourself and your desperation to follow the path which leads there. If you are continuously thinking about if you could reach FIRE you are pondering on the wrong question. The good ones are HOW and WHEN&#8230;</p>
<p>I also checked some blog posts about the topic. I tend to believe that <a href="https://www.getrichslowly.org/suze-orman-fire/">J.D. Roth is right</a> about her feelings. He wrote that&nbsp;<em>&#8220;I think she feels threatened&#8221;</em>. The FIRE movement is an organic, self-organizing thing. It has its heroes (and villains) but it does not need Suze Ormans to give you a one-size-fits-all type recipe to be financially successful. Especially if that includes spinning the hamster wheel into our seventies. The global mindset about how should we spend our working time is shifting. Deal with it. Also, as <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/suze-orman-new-avocado-toast-dont-buy/">Early Retirement Dude pointed out wonderfully</a>, throwing such a speech without backing it by rock-solid evidence besides her own thoughts is true irresponsibility. Like bringing a knife into a gunfight. Did you think that our legions of financial nerds will not go after you, call you out and tear your statements into pieces?</p>
<h2>Closing words</h2>
<p>Some folks hate Suze Orman, some folks love her. Some got disappointed right now and some still agree with her. But who am I to judge people for this? Everybody has the right to have an opinion. So do I. So does Suze&#8230; Let me add one of her quotes here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t let what others think or say get in your way; their actions reflect on them, not you.&#8221; &#8211; Suze Orman &#8211;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see? She is not wrong in everything and can give you valuable advice indeed. So stick to that and don&#8217;t let what she thinks or says get into the way of your FIRE plans. Her actions reflect on herself not you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Lastly, this is the final time for the mainstream media to kill not only the <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2018/10/05/the-fire-movement/">stereotype of the white male engineer</a> as the only potential FIRE prospect but also the image of the lazy quitter millennial who is desperately searching for an escape from the hamster wheel while dreaming about sitting on a pile of money (by luck or windfall) at a sunny beach sipping margaritas and scratching his balls all day. Please start painting a more accurate picture about FIRE folks. There are hundreds of mind-blowing examples out there. You only have to reach out to them&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in the time <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/the-only-thing-i-dont-get-about-reaching-fire/">I already wrote about</a> my thoughts on the fear of getting bored in retirement. I did not change my views but as keep seeing posts popping up about the topic I had a think what I would do after reaching FIRE. Of course besides the travel the world and spend most of my time with family general ideas. So here is it, check out my non-complete list of ideas for having fun in retirement.</p>
<h2>Art</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1049" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cupboard-349935_640-300x200.jpg" alt="cupboard" width="300" height="200">Anyone who knows me could tell that I am not much of an artist. Last time I tried to draw a horse my daughter was impressed by the result. She told me it is a cute dog&#8230; However, there is a field I see some opportunities. When I was a kid I wanted to become a carpenter. Later fell in love and this dream never came true but once I enter the FIRE club you could bet that I would happily dive into woodworking and craftsmanship. Probably would not build houses like MMM but definitely would put my skills into work on some smaller projects. So far I was fascinated by videos where someone turns old/used furniture and renovates it or turns into come completely different thing. Also, have a feeling for pyrography. What if I could combine this two, get some old wood material polish it and burn some text on it. Maybe financial quotes. Or program code <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Have some specific ideas too, like creating tables with board game boards burned onto the surface and boxes for keeping gaming equipment (like Munchkin cards, figures, and dices).</p>
<h2>Electronics</h2>
<p>Despite I love technology and would be happy to have the latest laptop or desktop machines all the time my frugal mindset would not let this to happen. Moreover, I like old computers and just looking around in our basement and seeing those old motherboards, memories, processors and other stuff collecting dust makes me sad. Of course, I don&#8217;t throw them out because what if someday I will need them? And that day could come after reaching FIRE. These old computers are no more considered as cutting edge or fast or (according to my wife) usable at all. But what if they should not be. What if they should only fulfill a purpose which is manageable to them?</p>
<p>Back in the time when I was a kid (before the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/coders-of-finance-kickoff/">Commodore and console age</a>) in summers, we were not only attending the local riverbank beach to refresh ourselves in the river but to check if the &#8220;Luna Park&#8221; arrived. Just in case you have no clue about that, there&nbsp;were groups who were wandering through the neighboring countries and settle down for a couple of weeks every now and then. Their business was to bring a minimalistic feeling of an amusement park for a short period of time.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1048" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fun-2570737_640-300x200.jpg" alt="arcade" width="300" height="200">These visited us pretty regularly, every summer for a couple of weeks. There was a huge metal box (maybe made of some containers) equipped with a dozen arcade machines, flipper tables and even some slot machines (which seemed pretty boring to us back then).&nbsp;We spent many hours throwing coins into the arcade machines, driving cars, shooting balloons (sometimes bad guys or aliens), and helping Pacman to fill his stomach.&nbsp;Have to grab the opportunity to thank Mr. RIP who reminded me of this memory while I was reading through <a href="http://retireinprogress.com/mystory1/">his origin story</a>. As a tribute to these times and to put the dusting hardware (and some of the previously mentioned carpentry skills) into work these old machines&nbsp;with a little(?) bit of labor and hacking around could turn into fully functional arcade machines. Then after having enough fun with ourselves could be donated to some good causes. My sister volunteered at an orphanage this summer in Romania. I bet those kids could use some old school fun.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Of course, I am a coder and always will be. Even after reaching FIRE I can not imagine my life without writing some code or at least create some kind of software. They say every programmer prepares to be a game programmer and later enter reality. I am not any different, that was my dream also, but did not search that path intentionally and life never dropped the opportunity in my way. Once I would finish mandatory work on questionable projects I could freely indulge into game development. There is a chance it would be a hard nut to crack so maybe I would get a team of more talented folks and pour my vision of a history-based strategy game into reality. Edutainment FTW.</p>
<p>Picking up game programming skills would provide me with another benefit. Teaching kids programming is something I really would like to try sometime (even before reaching FIRE) and doing this through game programming&nbsp;would probably be the most engaging way of it.&nbsp;Back in my higher education years, I had some chances to tutoring my classmates whose programming (and/or logic thinking) skills were worse than mine. I liked it and discovered that explaining things to someone else deepen my understanding even more. A very rewarding opportunity and what could be more beneficial than planting the seed of the love of coding into young minds? Can not come up with anything better <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>Gastronomy</h2>
<figure id="attachment_1041" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1041" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1041 size-full" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/langos.jpg" alt="langos" width="512" height="384"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1041" class="wp-caption-text">by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Globetrotter19">Globetrotter19</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know a lot of us has the &#8220;Barista FIRE&#8221; path in mind and I would lie if I&#8217;d say that I never had plans on taking a course, learn to make mindblowing cocktails, and set up a beach bar at a sandy beach in Greece. Another option would be to bring our beloved Hungarian/Serbian cuisine abroad. Read an article just the other day about a place at a Japanese beach where you could buy &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ngos">lángos</a>&#8220;. Unfortunately, the area got abandoned so the owner had to close it and move away. After that, he made the only logical next step. Opened another Hungarian restaurant&#8230; in Alaska. Sounds like a plan to me <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>Finally, the time would come to learn to play the guitar, get some fellows and form a punk band. Don&#8217;t expect any mainstream stuff, I only see two options. One is to revive the most popular tracks of our childhood. The other is to go full niche and find our voice. Every blogging course starts with this advice after all and music should be not any different. I guess in a world where cross-dressing fitness metal is a thing you cannot go too niche (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKwvtF1Y6Pw">check out if you dare</a>). As I have no interest in cross-dressing I would go with a much &#8220;closer to me&#8221; thing, nerd punk. If you have no idea what I am talking about check out this.</p>
<p><iframe title="&quot;Damage&quot; Music Video - 3d6" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/39vSWoXnf0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Have to admit that I never was so lucky to have the equipment or company to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons live so this could be another item on the FIRElist.</p>
<p>I am also a huge fantasy fan so a fantasy world themed band can be an option too. Like my new favorite, the Game-of-Thrones-themed nerd punk band, Daenerys and the Targaryens (must listen to GoT fans, check out both of their albums <a href="https://danyandthetargs.bandcamp.com">here</a>).</p>
<p><iframe title="&quot;Dracarys&quot; Daenerys &amp; the Targaryens at the Oriental" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nc_IP4MOevg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Or maybe simply turn the financial wisdom picked up through the years into lyrics? Who knows <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><em>That&#8217;s all for now. What do you think about these options? Are they too weird? Would you team up? Please share with me in the comments.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all,&nbsp;by FIREplace I meant the place where you retire to. I bet your instinctive answer to this question would be a huge YES. Also, probably you are already envisioning yourself enjoying the sun on a sandy beach in Spain, France or Italy. Or maybe you prefer indulging into the great fun what a capital city like London could offer? Or even would you just spend your time wandering around in the Alps in Switzerland or Germany? Riding a bike in Netherland or sweating in a sauna in Sweden? The list could go on and on. To be honest I cannot blame you and probably you are right.</p>
<p>But I want to discuss a different area today. We are heading to the eastern parts. As you may know, <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/escaping-the-matrix/">I am living in northern Serbia</a> so we will discuss local options. The numbers could be identical or pretty similar at least for other areas in the neighborhood. Narrow down this area to the places I know about from experience so let&#8217;s say my statements stand for Vojvodina (Serbia), Hungary and Transylvania (Romania).</p>
<p>Now it’s a fact that in the latest years this area is a not the place what comes to mind when you are thinking about where to move. People are leaving these ends in dozens every day searching for a better life in western Europe. I could not really point to a single family around here which does not have a member or a friend (or more) who works and lives abroad. The great majority is driven by financial reasons others by political or simply lifestyle preferences. Can not blame them, this area is not the best place for the average Joe for hoarding wealth. I would lie if I’d say I have never been tempted to leave. To be honest I am thinking about that option every now and then.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-991" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hitcher-1536748_1920-1024x681.jpg" alt="Hitcher" width="640" height="426"></p>
<p>Same time I always see people (unfortunately in very small numbers) who after living abroad for many long years finally gets defeated by homesickness and return to here. While that is a huge driving force there are other benefits of returning to the homeland after you have a steady pension or sufficient savings. In comparison to the states or even western Europe, this is a low-cost area.</p>
<p>Needs and wants in early retirement are very subjective things and highly affected by the lifestyle you used to live. I cannot promise that this area can provide you with everything, so for the sake of this thought experiment let’s assume that you are satisfied with what our little country could offer at other fields of life and let’s focus on the numbers. I will try to summarize the basic financial needs for living in the area looking for multiple options for spending ranges. So let&#8217;s see the &#8220;big three&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Housing</h2>
<p>There is the eternal debate of renting or buying but we will not cover that now. There are too many variables for every situation so let&#8217;s get some examples for both.&nbsp;This place is no different than others, the rental prices are highly dependent on the location and the type of the property.</p>
<h3>Renting</h3>
<p>If you are ok with living in the countryside you can find cheap accommodation in villages or small towns. The only problem here is to find a suitable property (the renting out culture is not that widely spread here). There is a chance that you will not find a flat in such areas but if you can find a house for rent you can probably get it for $70-$150/month. I heard about folks who were able to get a rental and not paying a dime for it just taking care of the place (while the owners were working abroad).</p>
<p>Small-medium sized cities are a little bit more expensive but also could offer more entertainment by the western standards. There is a chance that you can choose from a bigger assortment. From real-life examples, I could say that you can find a studio apartment (around 375sqft) for $100-$150, a medium-sized (around 540sqft) for $150-$300, and a big one (above 1000sqft) for $300-$500 per month. Rental houses are not as frequent here as they should be (trust me we were searching for one with no luck) but where you can find some the prices would be similar to flat rentals only houses can be found at more distant locations.</p>
<p>Big cities are the ones which I would avoid at any costs, but if you insist and want to find a reasonable and acceptable flat you would probably shell out similar amounts as in the western countries. The variability is so high that I would not even try to guesstimate exact numbers, but it could be anywhere above $500 and the sky is the limit.</p>
<h3>Buying</h3>
<p>Following the same distinction at smaller places, you can find properties for even a couple thousand dollars. I heard about whole farms which were bought for less than $10k (taxes and other expenses included). A good estimation for average house prices at these places is on the $10k-$30k scale depending on the size.</p>
<p>In medium-sized cities, flat prices vary from $750-$1250 per square meter (10sqft). Seemingly the real estate market is growing finally, there are a dozen constructions going on just in our city so we could say that there is a nice assortment. From my experience house prices for acceptable properties with average sizes (around 1500sqft home size on a 5000-7500sqft plot) would cost you $45k-$70k.</p>
<p>For big cities the situation is the same as for rentals, the prices could be similar to western mid-size places. Anyway assume a number north of the upper limits of the previous paragraph.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-994" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/house-970344_1920-1024x678.jpg" alt="House" width="640" height="424"></p>
<h3>Utilities</h3>
<p>In terms of utilities, I can only speak about my (and my peers) experiences. We used to live in a flat and our monthly bills added up to $110 per month on average. When we moved to our house our expenses rosed a bit thanks to heating bills. Electricity, water + sewer costs, waste removal, natural gas, landline + internet for our household averages around $200 per month. Your location does not really affect these numbers, the size of your home does.</p>
<h2>Transportation</h2>
<p>You should know two things about public transportation in Serbia. The first thing is that the tickets are not expensive. The second thing is that as a bonus you get an instant time travel 50 years back. While there are exceptions most vehicles are remainings of the last century and a lot of them are older than me.</p>
<h3>Railways</h3>
<p>My grandfather told me nice stories about the great Yugoslavian railways. <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/three-financial-lessons/">I wrote about him earlier</a> and told you that he was a &#8220;gastarbeiter&#8221; in Germany and he used the railways back then. The huge problem is that if you are not living in the middle of the country (around the capital city, Belgrade) if you see a newer train it is probably a foreign one. The rest of them are the same ones my grandpa used.</p>
<p>I had some friends who commuted to school by train. The rule was that if the train was not able to start in the morning the railway&nbsp;company provided an excuse to them for skipping the school that day. Once I was waiting for my train departure at 7&#8217;o clock in the morning. The first news was about a ten minute late. At 2 PM&nbsp;I gave up and went home. So, definitely not recommended for a daily commute.</p>
<p>Before I totally scare you away from using the railways in Serbia I have to tell that as a rule of thumb the longer the line of travel and the more international the line is the higher the probability is that the trip will actually happen. I used to travel a couple of times from the top of Serbia all the way down to the shores of the Adriatic sea in Montenegro for roughly 50 bucks. Also, if you want to experience the true essence of the Balkans I really recommend taking longer trips by train here. Expect something like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raby3rkC7Do">this video</a>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Bus companies</h3>
<p>As the glory of the railways was fading bus companies were breaking forth just to step on the same path. Again there are exceptions. As a rule of thumb the bigger the company is and have long and/or international lines the newer and better are the vehicles. The oldest ones are running between smaller towns and in public transport in small-medium sized cities. I remember a movie about the Montgomery bus boycott. Well, today I was traveling on a similar vehicle, maybe a little bit dirtier <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Again, prices are in correlation with the quality of the service. A local one-way bus ticket is $0.9, the monthly ticket is $25. Interurban lines are selling for roughly $0.15/mile. The exceptions are the international lines like the one to Austria. These are newer vehicles and a one-way ticket is $45. Tourist agencies have also good vehicles and fair prices, you can buy a return ticket to Chalkidiki, Greece for $70-80 per person.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-992" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bus-2423983_1920-695x1024.jpg" alt="Bus" width="640" height="943"></p>
<h3>Taxy &amp; Uber..ish companies</h3>
<p>Uber is non-existent over here but has some local flavors like&nbsp;<a href="http://appcargo.net/">CarGo</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.rs.blablacar.gg/">BlaBlaCar</a>. These are unfortunately usable only in bigger cities but you can find a taxi at pretty much every town. The prices are around $0.8 per km which I consider relatively cheap compared to western fares.</p>
<h3>Car ownership</h3>
<p>This is a topic worth a separate post alone so, for now, I would only tell that new car prices are relatively high, cars are not cheaper than in the western countries where salaries are multiples of ours. This sucks, I know but we are frugal folks after all so we buy only new to us cars, right?</p>
<p>Again a topic for a different day, but in terms of the used car market, you can buy a reliable smaller hatchback for $5-7k which can serve for a decade at least. Expect higher fuel prices than over the pond, still, if you travel in a group this could be a more economical option. If I don&#8217;t take the purchase price into account just the fuel and maintenance costs a family of four could probably travel by car for less (half-price to same cost range) than a bus ticket on a specific distance.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>And last but not least we reached the biggest positive factor in living here. As in a dominantly agricultural area, the local ingredients are relatively cheap and high in quality. Would not make a list myself here, but bumped into <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/food-prices/country_result.jsp?country=Serbia&amp;displayCurrency=USD">this great statistic site</a> lately. If you follow the link you can find a pretty accurate list from the basics and you can estimate your expenses based on your grocery buying habits. Let&#8217;s see some actual tips how should you get your food.</p>
<h3>Straight from the producer</h3>
<p>At almost every place there is someone who knows someone who produces this or that. While this is not an option for everyone if you can discover such a channel respect it as you probably found gold. This is the way to get the highest quality for the lowest price especially if you buy in bulk or if you become a loyal customer. If you are going through a village or small town and you see goods on a table or in buckets next to the road look for the owner, they will happy to serve you and even jump into juicy negotiations. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Farmers market</h3>
<p>The second best option and the best for the ones who like to do regular grocery shopping tours and get everything in one place. Vegetables, fruits, meat products and diaries are high in variability and the prices are good. The only important thing here is to always try to discover producers and try to avoid wholesalers to get the best quality for your money. Also, don&#8217;t really believe if you see an organic or bio label on anything. This trend is just conquering these parts and not totally respected by producers. I know about farmers who said when someone asked what is the difference between the bio and not bio versions that the non-bio producers are using chemicals by daylight&#8230;</p>
<h3>Supermarkets &amp; Hypermarkets</h3>
<p>These are offering pretty much everything exactly like anywhere else. The assortment is abundant, local stuff is dominant but you can find all the world-class brands and products. You should buy in bulk here everything you do not manage to get at the first two options.</p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-993" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/barbecue-1239145_1920-1024x778.jpg" alt="Meat" width="640" height="486"></h3>
<h3>Local food</h3>
<p>Ok, we reached even the most interesting part of this section. Similarly to cars this worth a separate post alone. If you are curious about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_cuisine">detailed list of the Serbian cuisine you can find it here</a>. Bakeries are the go to places in the morning to enjoy a full-filling burek (although not the healthiest choice) with jog(no h here)urt of course (for roughly $1.5-$2). Grill bars are literally everywhere, every little town has at least one of them. Unfortunately, they are renovating them to look more like fast food restaurants. Still, the end product is the same: tasty grilled meats and plenty of fresh veggies. You have to visit these places at lunch AND dinnertime ($2-$5/per meal). Yes, as you may be guessed your stomach <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/serbia/articles/11-traditional-serbian-dishes-you-need-to-try/">will be pampered here</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Oh, and at the end of the day you could still have only $10-$15 spent.</p>
<h3>Restaurants</h3>
<p>As a closing accord, I have to say that most of the restaurants over here are pretty good. They serve tasty meals for reasonable prices and most of the times the amounts are more than plenty. Of course in bigger cities, you could go for maximum fanciness at stellar prices but a reasonable small-middle sized city can offer you a very good quality and huge portions for around $5-$10 per meal. Even if I take into account the best restaurant in our town if you don&#8217;t pick something exotic (like sea-fish) you could fill your stomach for $8-$20. Add a glass of excellent local wine or artisan beer which would add another $3-$5 to the bill. Sounds tempting?</p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Living at our ends has its pros and cons just like any other place. This area is definitely not the best place for chasing FIRE. The only exception is if you can take advantage of geoarbitrage like hundreds of local companies and especially thousands of freelancers who provide high-quality professional services for the western world for western salaries. But as you were able to realize for now if you find the environment, the culture and the people over here a fit for your taste the countries of central-eastern Europe can be a tempting choice as a FIREplace. If nothing more, definitely worth an extended visit after you reached FIRE <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><em>What about you? Would you be able to retire to such a place? Do these numbers make these end tempting for FIREd folks? Share your ideas in the comments! See you soon.</em></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p>Hey everyone, I&#8217;m a 37-year-old single woman from London, who works in the IT sphere. I&#8217;m working towards FIRE and have an anonymous blog, Ms ZiYou documenting my journey. I want to show women they can work in tech, and by my answers below, you&#8217;ll see you don&#8217;t need to be obsessed with computers to do so.</p>
<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<h3>When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t really know &#8211; there was one BBC basic computer I remember in our primary school, which must have been the first I used. We used it to play old school games, such as Grannys Garden. Computers weren&#8217;t really a thing. At my secondary school, there were a few more computers, but even the computing class had 3 students to one computer. And at university, there were a few more computers, but they were not everywhere. We had a uni email but no-one to email. A lecturer told our class he had emailed us something, and we laughed at him.</p>
<h3>What was your first machine?</h3>
<p>I never had my own computer until the last year of uni, and that was mainly used (with dial-up) for the new-fangled internet and writing up uni work. I have no idea what it was, but I do know it cost me £1000, which was a lot of money. But I had the internet at home!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been a gamer or even a hardcore programmer &#8211; I don&#8217;t think they are essential skills you need to work in the IT industry.</p>
<h3>What about education? Was it related to computing? Did you learn in a traditional way? What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p>I have a BEng in chemical engineering, a very STEM subject. We used Matlab a lot, did some Autocad. One the actual programming side, we were not a very good class academically but we had a collaborative spirit that now serves me well in the corporate world. There was one VB project, that the whole class mega-collaborated on. You have to remember, at this time no one had a computer of their own, and our department only had 6 computers for about a thousand students, and computing rooms that could be used out of hours. It was just easier to share a computer and work together.</p>
<h2>Career</h2>
<h3>When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</h3>
<p>After uni, I worked in engineering for a few years, then decided it wasn&#8217;t for me. I then looked at my options and took a part-time job in a call centre to work out what to do next. A few months later, a full-time analyst job that interested me came up, and I grabbed the opportunity with both hands. I thrived in the new job, and my programming career began. I taught myself VBA, SAS, and SQL, and my role grew. The first promotion I went for I didn&#8217;t get and was devasted, but then a promoted position was made for me (my job was regraded) and I managed to ace that interview. I then got an internal sideways move to another team and delved hardcore into a more technical role. It was great fun, and eventually, a promoted position was again made for me which I interviewed for and got. After doing my time in industry, I lucked upon a consulting job that was recruiting for my exact skillset. I relocated to London for the job, which was absolutely the right decision. And after a few years, I left to consult freelance myself.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-958 size-large" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hand-2722107_1920-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chart Coding" width="640" height="427"></p>
<h3>What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked in good places and less good places. What I will say is that culture is local, and one team in a department can be very different from another team. I&#8217;ve worked in places where 50+ hour weeks were expected, and the work hard, play harder culture encouraged. And in other places where apathy and death by committee is the norm. In reality, I&#8217;d encourage trying out lots of places, only then you will know what type of company and team really works for you.</p>
<h3>How do you see the situation of women in our field?</h3>
<p>Tech has a massive women-problem. And it&#8217;s multi-faceted. Women are neither studying STEM enough nor are enough applying for tech roles, so there are not enough women coming into the industry. But that&#8217;s not the real problem. Bigger issues become apparent in tech roles when women have a much bigger attrition rate and lower promotion rate. The brogrammer stereotype is the reality of lots of tech departments, and the culture is such a turn off to women.</p>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<h3>What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</h3>
<p>My personal finances are doing amazingly well, I&#8217;m well on my way to achieving financial independence, and on track to reach there in 2.5 years. If you want the actual numbers, you can find them all over my blog, starting on my <a href="http://www.msziyou.com/numbers">numbers page</a>.</p>
<h3>Tell us about your journey so far?</h3>
<p>I start seriously saving for early retirement in 2015 and ramped up my efforts in 2016. So now I&#8217;m 2.5 years into my 5-year plan and things are going well. My income helps me keep my savings rate of 80%, which is key to such an ambitious FIRE plan.</p>
<h3>How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</h3>
<p>There is no doubt, without earning six figures I would not have been able to get to financial independence so quickly. So I am very thankful that my skillset has parlayed into a high earning profession.</p>
<h2>Opinions</h2>
<h3>Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p>No regrets really, apart from not learning to make better money sooner in my career. I go into more details on <a href="http://www.msziyou.com/what-prevented-six-figures-earlier">this post</a> what prevented me from earning six figures earlier. But given I learned in the end, it&#8217;s not a big regret &#8211; we all make mistakes along the way.</p>
<h3>Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly a great field to move into, but you need to make sure you are doing it for the right motivations, not just for the money. If you are naturally curious, love solving problems and don&#8217;t rest until you find the perfect solution you&#8217;ll be a great fit. Likewise, if you can explain the complex, framework issues and explain a problem to a coder and a business person, there is also a role for you.</p>
<h3>Tips for beginners?</h3>
<p>Everyone has to start somewhere, and there is no such thing as a silly question. If you want to start coding, there really is no better time than now to start. There is an abundance of free courses and tools online, all you need is to dedicate some time and brain power.</p>
<h3>How would you encourage young girls to step on this path?</h3>
<p>From my perspective, we need to ensure that we are encouraging kids of both sexes to get interested in the sciences at an early age. We need to root out all biases and provide girls with amazing role models who they can aspire to emulate. I&#8217;d expect young girls to get the same education and guidance as young boys, and any deviations to be challenged.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-959 size-large" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/matrix-2975868_1920-1024x683.jpg" alt="Matrix Girl" width="640" height="427"></p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<h3>What are your short-term and long-term goals for the future both financially and professionally?</h3>
<p>My short term and long term plans are exactly the same at this stage.<br />
Professionally that&#8217;s an easy question &#8211; I just aim to keep in contract at good rates for the next 2.5 years. I&#8217;m at the stage I&#8217;ll basically do anything if they pay me the right amount.</p>
<p>And that 2.5 years is relevant financially, as that&#8217;s when I forecast I&#8217;ll have enough funds to declare myself financially independent. All I need to do is keeping in work, maintain the 80% savings rate and the stock market not to crash.</p>
<h3>As far as I know, you have been bitten by the travel bug. What are the most interesting places where you have been and what are on top of your bucket list?</h3>
<p>Life has been good to me on the travel front so far. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of Europe and been on some amazing long-haul trips. You can see my full country list in <a href="http://www.msziyou.com/a-country-a-year">this post</a>. Trips that were especially epic were Peru and the Inca Trail, a trip that been long on my bucket list. Another even more epic was a Serengeti safari and climbing Kilimanjaro. Weirdly I did not even originally want to go on safari, but it seemed silly to not go since it was next door and not that much extra money. However, on the safari I was blown away by the wildlife; nothing can compare you to seeing wild lions by your truck or wild giraffes and zebras.</p>
<p>My bucket list is long, as well as the 150 countries I have not yet been to there are loads of places I want to explore again or in more detail. Top of the realistic list at the moment is Italy; I just love the food and wine there. And long term, when I retire I am going to slow travel and live nomadically for a good few years.</p>
<h3>If you would start your own startup what would it be about?</h3>
<p>I am 100% ready for a startup but have not been visited by that great idea yet. I am always on the lookout, who knows when the idea will land. On a serious note, weirdly I&#8217;m pretty sure I could run a startup and do all the business stuff no problem, it&#8217;s just that idea that I can be truly utterly passionate about that has not yet arrived.</p>
<h2>Preferences</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Favorite&#8230;</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Desktop OS:&nbsp;</strong>Anything &#8211; I run Windows at home, but use a lot of Unix at work.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile OS:</strong>&nbsp;Android &#8211; I maintain an anti-apple policy.</li>
<li><strong>Machine:</strong>&nbsp;Anything &#8211; I&#8217;m not fussy, and all processing is done on the cloud nowadays.</li>
<li><strong>Browser:</strong> Chrome</li>
<li><strong>Programming language:</strong> I don&#8217;t really care anymore &#8211; I&#8217;m a gun for hire. I do love SAS though.</li>
<li><strong>And the most important&#8230; spaces or tabs:&nbsp;</strong>Tabs. Spaces suck.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Coding exercise</h2>
<h3>Would you write a couple of lines of code to present a simple financial principle?</h3>
<p>I also suck at these. Instead, I&#8217;d say that in the corporate world, being able to talk clients out of silly requests is a skill you should prioritise.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p><em>Thank you for contributing to the series, I really liked your answers. I am pretty impressed with your consistency in maintaining your 80% savings rate and fast-tracking your FIRE journey to five years. All this while resisting lifestyle inflation and still achieving travel and other goals. Kudos to you!</em></p>
<p><em>I also think that all kids should be encouraged to experiment with science. The only reason that I asked about girls because according to my experience they need more encouragement to step on this path, mainly because of the stereotypes. I honestly think that we need more balance between the genders in our profession and that&#8217;s why I am a big fan of organizations like <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a>. Having daughters myself I really hope that someday they will dive into the wonderful world of computing even if their final career decision will be totally different.</em></p>
<p><em>Hope you enjoyed this episode.&nbsp;</em><em>See you soon.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Welcome back geeky FIRE seekers. Today I brought you the story of my newest (ex)coder-blogger friend all the way from the heart of Europe. Shame on me, I only found out about the existence of their great blog,&nbsp;<a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/">WhatLifeCouldBe.eu</a>&nbsp; a couple of weeks ago but digging through it is in progress. It turned out that they are very close to us both in terms of family situations and geographical distance. Enjoy!</i></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p>Heya. I&#8217;m Rob. We&#8217;re a Scottish (her) Hungarian (him) couple with two young kids who reached FI at 32 years while living in Germany. We started investing in real estate, started several side hustles, a profitable business and also invest in the stock market with ETFs. After more than 10 years in Germany, we moved to rural Romania where I&#8217;m from and where my parents live.</p>
<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<h3>When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p>I picked the IT class at high school (9-12th grade) so I started with 14 years to learn about coding and by my 18th birthday I did my first proper piece of software.</p>
<h3>What was your first machine?</h3>
<p>It must have been around &#8217;97, it was an Intel Pentium 166Ghz, 1Gb HDD and&#8230; pff&#8230; less than 512Mb Ram. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It was a great PC. Later I&#8217;ve got a Voodoo graphics accelerator and I rocked Tomb Rider on it&#8230;</p>
<h3>Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p>Well, in Romania back then nobody bought licenses so I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time hacking some PC games to make them work. I&#8217;ve learned a lot. I think this was the reason we have so many good developers now in Romania.</p>
<h3>What about education? Was it related to computing? Did you learn in a traditional way? What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p>Yeah, it was IT focused. Algorithms, Pascal and it got quite sophisticated with Backtracking and Recursivity. I then went to IT&amp; Economics which was a really good choice since it gives you insight in so many areas like marketing, management, finances, accounting, HR, stock market etc plus, 50% was coding.</p>
<h3>When did you start to work? Was it in your field?</h3>
<p>I always wanted to be a web programmer (PHP &amp; MySQL) right from the start of university. I actually became one and started working in this area. A couple of years of professional coding was enough for me to realize I don&#8217;t enjoy that so much and I gradually switched to consulting.</p>
<h3>How did you become an entrepreneur?</h3>
<p>I think it all started back in 1999 or so when I&#8217;ve got a CD burner and burned CDs for people for money <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I made enough money to buy a Dial-Up modem <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I remember that&#8230; Later I started making money with building websites from scratch. On paper, I became an entrepreneur by coincidence. The Germans didn&#8217;t want to give me work permit so the solution was to become a freelancer. Which I did. This meant, that I could keep those few little clients I had before and also have a kinda fulltime job as well. This was quite nice.</p>
<p>This was also an important milestone in my life. As a freelancer, I didn&#8217;t have to pay state pension. This made me a bit worried about my pension. I knew I had to do something and the private pension plans were not very appealing so this is when we started investing in real estate.</p>
<h3>What kind of services did you provide?</h3>
<p>I did the usual little websites. It started from scratch then the frameworks (Joomla) appeared. Then PHP / MySQL / JavaScript coding followed. Before I &#8220;retired&#8221; I&#8217;ve only used JavaScript a bit.</p>
<h3>What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p>I didn&#8217;t really enjoy the fast-changing technology. It always felt a bit like hacking, especially with JavaScript. So I&#8217;m not the sort of person who sits in a dark room and codes all night. I&#8217;ve done that, now I know I don&#8217;t like it. The industry? Well, huge future. Software and algorithms are going to shape our future world more and more. Look at Uber, the world&#8217;s biggest taxi company who don&#8217;t really own cars. Look at Amazon, the biggest online shop who don&#8217;t really produce anything and the list could go on and on. If you learn how to code, you&#8217;re future proof.</p>
<h3>What were your biggest challenge, failure, and success?</h3>
<p>My biggest challenge was my first project. I had to build one for my graduation. I was so proud of myself. I felt like there are no limits to what I could build in that programming language (FoxPro). Loved the feeling.</p>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<h3>What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re FI for about 3 years now but, as it happens we&#8217;re still earning money with stuff we enjoy doing.</p>
<h3>Would you share your FI strategy and journey briefly?</h3>
<p>Basically, we&#8217;re pretty diversification freaks. We invested a lot in real estate (1st pillar), I started an online business (2nd pillar), we both have skills that we can use anytime to make money (3rd pillar) and all that left is going to the stock market (4th pillar) if we feel like it&#8217;s good time to invest. We wrote about this <a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2016/01/02/financial-independence-strategy">strategy here</a> and this is <a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2015/12/03/financial-independence-in-9-years/">how we reached FI</a> in detail.</p>
<h3>How did your profession affect your finances?</h3>
<p>Fun fact about us is, that our highest paying side hustle (150-209€/h) had nothing to do with our professions (<a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2016/01/24/how-to-earn-154-an-hour-without-a-degree">see details here</a>), which was a caretaker job we did for 1.5 years. So if you ask me whether you need to be a coder or engineer to reach FI, my answer would be absolutely not!</p>
<p>Still, being a coder and having experience in building websites helped us a lot reaching FI, no question about that. The thing is, that if you have a good idea for a portal, a software or an App it can catapult you into FI in no time (sometimes a year or less could be enough). It allows you to build your money-making-machine, your source of passive income if you use your skills wisely.</p>
<h2>Opinions</h2>
<h3>Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p>Being a coder helped my consultant career a lot. I had to deal with IT guys and they like to talk to consultants who know their &#8220;language&#8221;. Most consultants in my field didn&#8217;t have a coder background and for me, this made a huge difference.</p>
<p>If I could, I would change the educations system in a way that it allows kids to find their passion as quickly as possible and I would let them focus on that rather than learn about chemistry if you clearly want to become a coder.</p>
<p>What would I change in my career? I would start being properly self-employed a lot earlier.</p>
<h3>Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p>If they enjoy it yes. If not&#8230;no&#8230; One should do what one enjoys doing. But EVERYBODY should learn a bit of algorithms and coding early on so the can decide for themselves. It should be mandatory!</p>
<h3>Do you have some tips for beginners?</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t sit in front of the TV or on Facebook so much. Start thinking about what you really want to do. What do you want to build? Virtually everything could be learned from the internet. Start doing it. Invest in your education. Not necessarily money, but time.</p>
<h3>Whom do you recommend indulging in entrepreneurship?</h3>
<p>I think everybody should be offered the chance to try different forms of entrepreneurship. They could then choose for themselves if they enjoy doing it.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<h3>You are a coder, a freelancer, an internet marketer, an online business owner, a blogger, a community builder, a real estate investor, and who knows what else <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Would you share your goals and plans for these projects with us?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve quit my coding customers long ago so this is not an issue anymore&#8230; I&#8217;m an ex-coder <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I quit my consulting customers mid-2017. It paid well (over 100€/h) and I could do it remotely but I felt like my work doesn&#8217;t really have any impact on anything I felt even slightly meaningful so I dropped it.</p>
<p>My only business is my baby. I love watching it grow, watching all the new features it can do every other day. I like the fact that I can have a real positive impact on the lives of thousands of people. So yeah, I have no plans of stopping this although, who knows. Next year I might have my focus on other stuff.</p>
<p><a href="http://firehub.eu/">FIREhub.eu</a> is a project we started at the Financial Independence Week Europe 2017 with a few other European folks. It should be the home for everything about FIRE in Europe with a curated articles list, blogs list, Wiki, Events, and Podcasts. It&#8217;s a not-for-profit project and I&#8217;d like to see other people jumping onboard and see it grow. It&#8217;s also a platform we use to get to know many interesting people.</p>
<p><a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/fiwe-2018/">FIWE</a> &#8211; the Financial Independence Week Europe is a fun, not-for-profit conference-meetup that we started in 2016 and in June 2018 we have the 3rd edition. We love to meet new amazing people, make friends and connect people. We enjoy it a lot, it&#8217;s also something that Emma (my wife) and I are doing together (apart from our blog). It&#8217;s quite important for us as a couple to have shared projects.</p>
<p>On the real estate side, we don&#8217;t plan on expanding. In fact, we might even sell some in the future. We don&#8217;t really enjoy dealing with tenants. Luckily we don&#8217;t have to do that too much. It&#8217;s pretty passive.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget that we&#8217;re also parents to two really sophisticated, energy-intensive little creatures. I don&#8217;t even understand how we have time to do anything else&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh&#8230;we&#8217;re also environmental activists and we want to make the world plastic free and idiots free. I know we have a long way to go&#8230; but hey, you have to start somewhere&#8230; My next goal is to make my hometown sustainably cleaner and stop the authorities dumping all the plastic waste from the town into&#8230; you guessed it&#8230; a lake. Not nice isn&#8217;t it. It&#8217;s quite challenging to find solutions here without getting in trouble&#8230;</p>
<h2>Preferences</h2>

<h2>Coding exercise</h2>
<h3>Would you write a couple of lines of code to present a simple financial principle?</h3>
<pre>FI = getYourShitTogether()

function getYourShitTogether() {
    tv=FALSE;
    stupid-expenses = startTrackingYourExpenses();
    expenses = expenses - stupid-expenses;

    array_sh=thinkAboutSideHustles();
    passive_income = implementSideHustles(array_sh);

    self-employment= thinkAboutABusiness();
    passive_income += implementBusiness(self-employment)

    return passive_income - expenses;
}</pre>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p><em>Thank you, Rob, for participating in this series. It was very interesting to get to know your tech background and professional journey more. I honestly think that it is very interesting and we can learn a lot from you about hard work, following your dreams and most importantly bending the system to fit your goals <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>
<p><em>While this post is going online somewhere at a lovely place at Timisoara a bunch of European FIRE folks are gathering to have a great weekend at FIWE 2018 conference. A huge shout out to all of you and wishing a lot of fun, interesting conversations and plenty of good wine and food for the following days.</em></p>
<p><em>Hope you enjoyed this episode.&nbsp;</em><em>See you soon.</em></p>
