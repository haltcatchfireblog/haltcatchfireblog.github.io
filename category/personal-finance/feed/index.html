<p><em>This is again not the post I wanted to publish next. It seems I make a habit out of this. Not sure if I can produce anything of value anymore. At least not now. Not in the current situation. Not in my current state of mind. This post will be a burst out of my swirling thoughts. I think I need this to lessen the pressure inside. To prevent an explosion. So don&#8217;t expect anything more structured or sophisticated than a flow of consciousness on this piece of digital paper. A snapshot of my mind. Behold&#8230;</em></p>



<h2>Fear arises</h2>



<p>I am not the doomsday sayer type. Nor am I one who is all ears for any new conspiracy theory. I like to think of myself as a realist. Ok, I am sometimes too optimistic about some topics but we are speaking now in general. When I heard about the outburst of this new epidemic in China I barely raised an eyebrow. Not that I did not feel empathy for those people. I did. I do. Just the whole thing seemed so distant and so unrelated. Another one of their problems which they will probably solve. Then it started to spread steadily.</p>



<p>At that point, I still did not think much about it. But it was always in the back of my mind. Leaving me feeling unease. Then it hit Europe. I did not start running around and shouting that the sky will fall. But the fear did start growing inside. When I expressed my concerns to my friends they still seemed uninterested. Without any fear. Without any concern. Some made a joke out of it. Despite all that, I was not able to let it go. In my gut I felt that this sh*t is serious, why isn&#8217;t anyone taking it seriously? I still don&#8217;t get it.</p>



<p>I started checking the infection maps and numbers multiple times a day. As there appeared more and more red dots and they got closer and closer my mind started to converge towards the emergency state. I realized that the question is not that if it will hit us but when. I realized that the question is not that if we will be affected but how much. I did not expect fast and effective intervention from the government. If better-organized countries with more resources and more developed systems were not able to prevent and/or handle the situation properly then how can I expect that ours will?</p>



<p>This was about when I started to feel flu-like symptoms. Spoiler alert, I am not infected by the coronavirus. At least as far as I know. Still, I have to tell this did not help. As it came it went away on a weekend. Leaving behind an occasional cough and a sneezy nose. Life went on but suspicion remained. I told my wife we should go shopping. That was the point when she checked my temperature because it is pretty rare when I initiate such a thing. Yes, a stocking up tour was long due because of pure leisure and financial concerns. This time I initiated it because of preparation.</p>



<p>This was the time when my wife started to be concerned. After all, there is a dynamic and there are roles in every relationship and in ours, she is the one who is freaking out for things, most of the time I am just meh. The fact that now I was the freaked out one raised her concerns pretty much. So we went shopping. And somehow it felt stupid. We did not buy much stuff but stocked up two weeks&#8217; worth of groceries and other necessary stuff. And the sky still wasn&#8217;t falling.</p>



<p>The situation got more and more serious day by day. The public still was meh. The week passed. We went on another shopping tour, bought back what we consumed and another two weeks&#8217; worth of stuff. Meanwhile, the disease arrived into the country. Interestingly people still were not really much concerned.</p>



<p>I went to the office on Monday. There were still some jokes but the kind which you tell to calm down the situation. It felt that folks started taking it seriously. Company communication followed and as I was still experiencing flu-like symptoms which got a little bit worse again I remained home on Tuesday and started the recommended 14 days just in case. Days went by and the European countries started making tough decisions. Every day another one of them closed partially or totally, borders, cities, airlines, schools, etc. Shit just got really real.</p>



<p>Then Sunday evening came and I did something I did not do since, maybe the NATO bombings. I watched the live broadcast of the Serbian national television. The president held a speech and declared a state of emergency. His face was a mixture of feelings. Exhaustion, fear, anger, and disbelief. I have to tell that I am not really fond of the guy but now he seemed serious. He seemed like he means what he said and he cares about it. And this scared me even more.</p>



<p>You cannot hear me appraise our government and politics much in general but this time they acted faster and more efficiently than I expected. Actually, today they brought, even more, stricter sanctions as people did not take it seriously enough. So here we are today, 16th of March 2020. Borders closed. Schools canceled. All kinds of public activities prohibited. Military and police patrolling and guarding hospitals and other important buildings. A curfew in place for anyone older than 65 risking a fine of €1275 if they leave their homes. Same for the ones who break the rules of mandatory quarantine. And I honestly think this is the right way. An uncomfortable but right way. I hope it won&#8217;t be too little too late.</p>



<h2>Gratitude and doubt arises</h2>



<p>I cannot help but I feel grateful. We are finally debt-free. No more monthly payments. We have a roof above our heads. No rent payable. We have a pantry packed with items that can last at least a month, maybe more. No fear of starving. We have a small emergency fund that can buy us four months of livelihood. No shortage of the essentials. I have a job that is stable, the management is understanding, pays salaries on time (trust me, this is not default in our country) and can be done remotely if needed. Until we have electricity and internet connection life could go on without any serious restrictions. Why do I feel guilty about that?</p>



<p>I think about the folks who aren&#8217;t as lucky as us. The ones who cannot afford to have a stay at home parent. The ones who don&#8217;t have a garden and are enclosed between the four walls with demanding children. The ones whose jobs are evaporating from one moment to another. The ones who are in debt to their eyeballs. The ones who live from paycheck to paycheck. The ones who have no one to rely on. The ones who have to go to work every day despite the situation. The ones who have to risk their lives to help others survive. The ones who are laying on a bed connected to a respiratory machine waiting to get better. I feel their pain. I hear their struggles. And I have to push these thoughts away as I cannot cope with their weight.</p>



<p>This is one of those times when we have to see how fragile is our everyday lifestyle. How much we take luxuries granted. Self-sustaining households were providing the everyday basics for themselves a century ago. Nowadays we are chasing money and take the abundance of supply natural. Consumerism for the win. Are we all pathetic fools? Are we doomed to fail? Will the society inevitably falling apart? Ok, I stop. As I said I am not a doomsday sayer and I don&#8217;t want to become one. Sometimes these questions arise and only time will tell the answers.</p>



<p>Here I sit at my kitchen table in the middle of the night. Disturbed by these thoughts. Thinking about possibilities. Evaluating options and risks. I wrote about some <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/when-necessities-become-luxuries/">serious shit we went through</a> in our lives. But this situation is a metaphoric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_incognita">&#8220;Terra Incognita&#8221;</a>. Unknown land. No one knows how will this fold out. No one knows where does this situation going. No one knows when will it end, how will it form our future and what will it leave behind. What will be the costs? In lives. In money. In economic growth. What will evolve? What will be erased? Will there be dragons? If only I knew the answers&#8230;</p>

Enjoy!</p>
<h3>Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p>Hello. I’m a blogger who primarily blogs about personal finance. My website is Freedom Is Groovy. My wife and I started the blog in August of 2015 and we go by the monikers Mrs. Groovy and Mr. Groovy, respectively. We haven’t revealed our true identities in order to maintain a bit of privacy.</p>
<h3>Tell us a nerdy secret if you have one</h3>
<p>I’m 57 years old and I’m still intrigued by math. I have a Khan Academy login and I try to do one or two math problems a day. If Mrs.G. would let me, I’d like to take our country’s leading standardized test for college admission again, the SAT.</p>
<h3>When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p>I was in college in the early 80s and my housemate was an engineering student who actually had a personal computer (very rare back then). I don’t know exactly what he did with his PC. It and the software that came with it was very crude. All I know is that he would use his PC to connect to our school’s engineering department over the phone line and our house phone would be out of commission for hours.</p>
<h3>What was your first machine?</h3>
<p>My first PC an Epson (yes, the company primarily known for printers used to make PCs). I bought it in 1986 or 1987, and the hard drive was only 20 megabytes. I couldn’t afford the 40-megabyte hard drive model. Oh, and I bought my first PC because I wanted to write a book.</p>
<h3>Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p>I jumped straight into programming. I worked in a highway department and all the roads we maintained were cataloged in a Word document (we called it the “street dictionary”). Anyway, for a number of reasons I won’t detail here, cataloging our roads in a Word document wasn’t very practical. So I took it upon myself to manual type all the information from our street dictionary into an Access database. Learning Access databases led me to VBA and SQL, and VBA and SQL let me to C++.</p>
<h3>What about education, was it related to computing, did you learn in a traditional way or something else?</h3>
<p>I studied sociology, journalism, and public administration&#8211;nothing related to computers and programming. I got the database and programming bug in the mid-90s and I’m entirely self-taught. Back then I would just buy one database or programming book at a time and just plow through it.</p>
<h3>What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p>I have a BA in sociology, a BS in journalism, and an MPA in public administration.</p>
<h3>When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</h3>
<p>I got my first real job in 1986. As already mentioned before, it was with a highway department on Long Island, New York. I started off as a clerk in the personnel department and eventually got promoted to a construction inspector after passing a civil service exam. About three years into my construction inspector career, I was put in charge of rating all the roads we maintained. Part of this new assignment also meant maintaining the street dictionary I mentioned earlier, and the street dictionary proved to be the impetus of my IT career.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I was the highway department’s IT for over ten years but my titled never changed from a construction inspector. My highway department didn’t have any computer or programming related job titles at the time.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Groovy and I left Long Island in 2006 and relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina, I got my first IT job with an actual IT title. I was a data analyst for a healthcare consultant and I mainly did what I did for the highway department&#8211;create and manage databases and write code.</p>
<h3>What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p>I only worked formally in the IT sector for ten years. And I only worked for one company during that ten year period. And what pleasantly surprised me about this company was that it wasn’t a slave to formal credentials. Most of the IT people in this company had computer science degrees. But at least a third didn’t. All this company cared about were skills. If you had the skills, you would be hired and promoted. It didn’t matter whether you learned those skills in college or on your own. And just for the record, there were four guys at this company that I really looked up to. Their programming skills were off the charts. Two had computer science degrees and two were self-taught.</p>
<h3>What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</h3>
<p>I am currently retired. Mrs. Groovy and I achieved financial independence in 2014 but didn’t retire until October of 2016. We wanted to make sure we entered retirement with a nice cushion.</p>
<h3>Tell us about your journey so far?</h3>
<p>For Mrs. Groovy and me, the key to achieving financial independence was getting out of debt and owning our home outright. Once you have shed the mortgage, the car loan, and the credit card debt, the cost of living is remarkably cheap, especially in the southern portion of the United States. When we became completely debt free and owned our home outright in 2006, we were able to save over half of our gross household income. Save over half of your gross household income for ten years and you’ll have a good chance of achieving financial independence&#8211;providing the stock market doesn’t frown on you, of course. Another key was finding contentment in the ordinary. If you need fancy cars, clothes, electronics, and vacations to secure happiness, you’ll have a very difficult time-saving money and achieving financial independence. Don&#8217;t’ get me wrong. Mrs. Groovy and I appreciate fabulous stuff just like everyone else. In fact, we’re spending five weeks in Australia later this year. But we get just as much joy out of playing cards with family and friends or going out for ice cream on a Saturday night, or reading a good book. Master the art of being happy with less and life will get incredibly easy.</p>
<h3>How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</h3>
<p>Being an IT guy primarily affected my finances by making me a coveted employee. Once I developed top-notch database skills, I had no problem securing employment, promotions, and bonuses. For instance, at my last job, I started off as a data analyst. Then I was promoted to program specialist, and soon after that, I was promoted to program manager. And all because I had a knack for manipulating data, automating tasks, and writing complex SQL.</p>
<h3>Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p>Yes. And it doesn’t take much to see if you have an aptitude for IT field. If you’re a cubicle jockey who primarily answers phone calls and performs data entry, start teaching yourself Excel and Access. And after three months or so of learning the basics of spreadsheets and databases, start trying to automate aspects of your job with Excel, Access, and VBA. It’s a great way to learn something on your boss’s dime and make your job easier. Also, it’s a great way to advance your career. Become good at automating routine office tasks and you will become a very valuable employee.</p>
<h3>Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p>Hell no! My biggest regret is that I didn’t discover databases and programming sooner.</p>
<h3>Tips for beginners?</h3>
<p>Start. Download Notepad++ and start coding with Javascript. Go to the W3School and the Khan Academy and start working through the Javascript tutorials. Once you get comfortable with Javascript, move on to PHP or Python. Finally, you should become familiar with databases and SQL. Backend databases hold the world’s data and once you can communicate with databases via SQL, you have all the world’s data at your fingertips. Very powerful. Download the latest express edition of SQL Server from Microsoft and start honing your SQL skills (the express version is free).</p>
<h3>Which technology area picks your brain most these days?</h3>
<p>I’m out of the IT business these days. I mainly occupy my brain by reading and writing about personal finance. Before I left the workforce in 2016, I was very intrigued by No SQL databases. No SQL databases store data in free-flowing tables. One row might have ten columns and the next row might have twenty columns. Apparently, this kind of storage works better with massive amounts of data than regular SQL databases. You can retrieve your data faster. Anyway, during the last year or so of my career, I started playing around with Mongo, an opensource No SQL database. So if I were still in the IT game today, I would be honing my No SQL skills.</p>
<h3>What do you think is the biggest improvement/challenge the IT industry looking forward these days?</h3>
<p>Today, it’s much easier to teach yourself and prove to potential employers that you have the requisite skills. And you don’t have to be rich to go the DIY route. When I got interested in databases and coding in the 90s, there was no opensource software, no YouTube, no Khan Academy, no GitHub, no high-speed internet, and no blogosphere. I imagine there were some certifications back then, but I don’t recall any. If people wanted to get a worthwhile IT credential, they had to go to college.</p>
<h3>We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</h3>
<p>• Desktop OS: Windows 10<br />
• Mobile OS: Android<br />
• Machine: HP<br />
• Browser: Chrome<br />
• Programming language: SQL (I know. Not really a language, but I’m an SQL junkie.)<br />
• And the most important… spaces or tabs: Tabs</p>
<h3>Would you write a couple of lines of code to present a simple financial principle?</h3>
<pre>Dim curMonthlyExpenses as currency
Dim curMonthlyTakeHomePay as currency
Dim sSQL as string

curMonthlyTakeHomePay = $6000

sSQL = “Select Sum(Amount) From ExpenseLogTable Where Month(ExpenseDate) = 4;”

curMonthlyExpenses = GetMonthlyExpenses(sSQL)

If curMonthlyTakeHomePay - curMonthlyExpenses &gt; 0
    DepositMoneyIntoBrokerageAccount(curMonthlyTakeHomePay - curMonthlyExpenses)
Else
    MsgBox (“You’re spending too much!”)</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, groovy freedomist, that’s all I got. What say you? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><em>(Sorry, but cannot resist stealing your finishing line)</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back geeky FIRE seekers. The Coders of Finance series returns for 2019 and we kick off the year with&#160;Marc from VitalDollar.com.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><i>Welcome back geeky FIRE seekers. The <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/coders-of-finance/">Coders of Finance</a> series returns for 2019 and we kick off the year with</i>&nbsp;Marc from <a href="https://vitaldollar.com">VitalDollar.com</a>. I just realized browsing the previous episodes that despite we are all coders how different our paths, visions, mindsets, and skillsets are. Marc just raises this diversity further. His way of running his business is truly inspiring and his achievements aren&#8217;t small wins in my opinion. So, Marc please take it over.</em></p>
<h3>Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Marc. I’m 40 years old and I live in Pennsylvania with my wife and our two kids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My experience is different than most of the other people who have been interviewed in this series. I have some experience with web design and development, but most of my experience is related to online business. I got started with web design, but that led to me creating my own websites and blogs. I’ve been managing my own sites/blogs full-time since 2008.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I think of myself as an online entrepreneur first, an interest in web design was really what started it all. I used to design and code custom WordPress themes and websites for small businesses, both for clients and to create and maintain my own websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ran a web design blog from 2007 &#8211; 2013 (more on that in a minute) so I worked in the industry even though I wasn’t taking that many client projects for most of those years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the web design blog, I’ve also had blogs on photography, travel, and now finance. </span><a href="https://vitaldollar.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VitalDollar.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a personal finance blog, is my current project.</span></p>
<h3><b>Tell us a nerdy secret if you have one</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think my secret is that I don’t have a whole lot in common with most developers. My background is in business and what really attracted me to web design and development was the possibility of being able to create my own websites in order to make money. I saw the entrepreneurial side of it, and that led me to an interest in learning how to code.</span></p>
<h3><b>When was your first encounter with computing?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My parents had a desktop computer when I was pretty young (I guess it was in the mid-80’s). I used it to play games. I had a baseball game that I loved to play, and there was also some horse racing game that was a lot of fun betting on fake horses. I remember the graphics were terrible. It looked like little chairs moving, nothing like horses. Looking back, I guess I’m kind of fortunate that I didn’t develop a gambling addiction. </span></p>
<h3><b>What about education, was it related to computing, did you learn in a traditional way or something else? What kind of degree do you have?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My degree is in Business Administration, but in my last semester I took an elective course on web design and I really loved it. The course was very basic HTML and some graphics. By the end of the course, we were able to create a basic table-based website (this was back in 2002).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That course really got me interested, and since I was majoring in business I saw the potential in being able to code my own websites as business experiments. After college, I continued to learn on my own by reading books and following online tutorials. I had to learn CSS because the course didn’t cover that at all. I played around creating some websites of my own just to learn, although I don’t think any of those websites went live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2006, I started doing some web design for friends and family that had small businesses. I enjoyed it and I needed some extra money, so in 2007 I decided to try to expand and find clients from outside of my personal network. I set up a portfolio website and a blog to try to attract traffic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That blog took off really quickly. It did help me to land some clients, but I realized I didn’t really like the client work, and I actually liked working on my own blog more. I decided to shift my focus, and from then on my blog content targeted other web designers, rather than potential clients for my services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the target audience of my blog was other designers, I did get a decent number of potential clients contacting me through the site. I didn’t take on a lot of client work, but if there was a project that looked like a good fit, I would pursue it. It was mostly websites for small businesses and non-profit organizations, including a few churches. Most of them were custom WordPress themes, but I did do a few static HTML websites for clients, and I worked with a few other content management systems, like LightCMS.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1347" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/workstation-405768_1920.jpg" alt="Workstation" width="1920" height="1294"></p>
<h3><b>When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I graduated from college in 2002, and I worked in a few different jobs in the finance industry from 2002 &#8211; 2008. Although I always had work, I struggled to find a job that I liked. I wanted something that would give me a chance to grow and develop, but everything just seemed like a dead end job. That’s really what led me to start my web design and blogging side hustle in 2007.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2008, about 1.5 years after starting my blog, I was able to leave my job and pursue my own business full-time. At that point I was making some advertising revenue from my blog, doing some freelance writing for other web design blogs, and a small amount of client work for web design and website maintenance.</span></p>
<h3><b>What are your experiences about the industry?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve never worked as an employee in the industry. I did some freelance work for a few years, and I’ve also managed my own websites and blogs since 2007. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a web design blog, of course, I had plenty of contact with other web designers and developers. I always enjoyed getting to know other people in the industry, and I found designers and developers to be very welcoming.</span></p>
<h3><b>Are you still coding?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not really. The extent of my coding now is limited to some small customizations to the styling of WordPress themes, or maybe some opt-in forms. I always coded my own sites up until about 2014. Running my own sites kept me busy enough that I didn’t have time to really get practice and stay up-to-date with trends when mobile browsing became a lot more popular. Another factor was that premium WordPress themes were getting easier to customize, so for the past few years, it has made more sense for me to use available themes rather coding from scratch. When I started coding responsive themes it was taking me too long. With plenty of WordPress themes available, it just seemed unnecessary to do it myself.</span></p>
<h3><b>How has the ability to code impacted your business?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My business started when I was doing freelance web design work, so it never would have started without coding. My interest in design and development allowed me to grow a successful blog that gave me a great start to my career and had a big impact on my family’s finances.</span></p>
<h3><b>What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I are hoping to be able to retire early, but not exceptionally early. She has been a stay-at-home mom since our daughter was born in 2012. We hope that she’ll be able to work with me in a few years once our son starts school (our daughter is in kindergarten this year).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to be able to retire by the time our youngest graduates from high school, which should be about 15 years from now. I would be about 55, and my wife would be about 53. We’re on track to reach those goals, but in the world of self-employment, you really never know what might happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t view financial independence quite the same as some other people in the FI community. I don’t think 25x our annual expenses is enough for either my wife or I to feel freedom over money. To me, the whole point of financial freedom is the actual feeling and relief of not needing to worry about money. Our goal is to have 50x our current annual expenses, which I should allow both us to truly feel that freedom. Right now we’re about halfway there.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1348" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/keyboard-338505_1920.jpg" alt="Camera" width="1920" height="1271"></p>
<h3><b>Tell us about your journey so far?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My 20’s were pretty much a waste financially. Like I mentioned earlier, I wasn’t able to find a job that I liked, and my income was on the lower side all the way through my 20’s. I started my web design and blogging side hustle when I was 28 and left my full-time job right when I turned 30. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, my 30’s were much more productive years. I was able to have some success with the web design blog that originally started as a side hustle. I managed that blog for several years before I sold it in 2013 for $500,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, I had a few different photography blogs that I started. I’ve sold those blogs now (you can read on my blog about </span><a href="https://vitaldollar.com/how-to-make-money-from-hobby/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how I turned a photography hobby into more than $1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), but they were a lot of fun to manage for a few years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I’m focusing on growing Vital Dollar, although I also have a few small </span><a href="https://vitaldollar.com/build-a-niche-website/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">niche websites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><b>How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think my profession has significantly impacted my finances. When I started my own business our financial situation wasn’t that great. We weren’t in debt, aside from a mortgage, but we were saving enough money to reach our goals. We managed our money pretty well, but our income wasn’t high enough to allow us to meet aggressive goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I started my own business, my income has been significantly higher. My wife was able to leave her job, which never would have been possible on my old income. We’ve also been able to grow our net worth, </span><a href="https://vitaldollar.com/realities-of-mortgage-free-living/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay off our mortgage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and give ourselves a shot at reaching our early retirement goals.</span></p>
<h3><b>Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would definitely recommend an online business for anyone who is interested, and willing to put in the work. It wasn’t easy and took some sacrifices early on, but it has paid off. I love being able to work from home and choose the projects that I work on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the coders out there, personal projects and side hustles are a great way to get started with entrepreneurship.</span></p>
<h3><b>We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Desktop OS &#8211; Mostly PC, but I also have a Mac. I don’t really have a preference, I just have more experience with PC and they’re cheaper, so that’s what I typically use. On my photography blogs I sold some downloadable products that were basically software add-ons, so I have both so I could test my products.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mobile OS &#8211; Android. I’ve never used anything else.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Browser &#8211; Mostly Chrome, but I also use Firefox. There are a few Chrome extensions that I use a lot, so that’s the main reason I stay mostly in Chrome.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Thank you, Marc, that you have shared your journey with us. All of us can learn something from you. Many coders are just dreaming about dedicating themselves to their own projects full-time. Of course, it is not without reason as a huge percentage of startups fail pretty quickly. Playing it safe and starting something on the side is always a good idea and still lets you test the waters.</em></p>
<p><em>What do you think? Which would bring more success to a coder as an entrepreneur, business skills or technical skills, or both on an equal level? Share your thoughts with us in the comments.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, dear reader, you have read it right. That&#8217;s my question. As many of you know, despite I live in Serbia I am a Hungarian guy and count Hungary as my homeland too. Thus, every sometimes, when I cheat on my low information diet I follow the news over there. Last week the Hungarian prime minister <a href="https://bbj.hu/politics/orban-reveals-radical-family-support-package_161331">revealed a radical family support package</a>&nbsp;as part of their action plan to prevent the demographic decrease.</p>
<p>I am not really <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/three-financial-lessons/">involved in politics</a> and have limited knowledge of economics so won&#8217;t go into any detailed analysis or debate about the political or economic background or rationality of this package. Instead, I thought it would be fun to play the &#8220;what if&#8221; game and&nbsp;run a thought experiment using the numbers which were the just presented. As the system is pretty complicated and has many restrictions for many situations I will only walk through an ideal use case.</p>
<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the following assumptions to sketch up the most ideal situation to take advantage of these benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a newlywed couple and this is their first marriage.</li>
<li>The wife is in the middle of her twenties and has spent a little more than three years in the workforce.</li>
<li>They have no kids yet but the wife is already pregnant.</li>
<li>They have plans on having a family with three kids in the next ten years.</li>
<li>Both of them are employed and to make it simply they have no debt.</li>
<li>Even better if the wife has student loans, as in case of having three kids the loan could be forgiven.</li>
<li>They are renting currently but their biggest dream is to move into their own family home.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is our basic setup, a very typical one I think.</p>
<h3>Initialization</h3>
<p>According to the newly presented information every young mother who agrees (don&#8217;t have to be pregnant or have kids already) to give birth in the following five years would be granted an interest-free general purpose personal loan of 10 million Hungarian forints (about $35.436).</p>
<p>Moreover, because of the Home Purchase Subsidy Scheme for Families, known by its Hungarian acronym &#8220;CSOK&#8221;&nbsp;they are eligible for another 10 million HUF (about $35.436) as a non-refundable grant in case they sign that they will have three kids in ten years (both giving birth an adopting is an option).</p>
<p>Because of the &#8220;CSOK&#8221; they are eligible for a government-supported mortgage of 15 million HUF&nbsp;(about $53.170) with a fixed 3% interest rate. The common mortgages on the market have an interest rate of about 5%. We pick a 20-year contract with a fixed interest rate throughout the whole period.</p>
<p>Our couple signs up for all these benefits and after searching diligently they find their&nbsp;dream home, a newly built turnkey house with all the necessary appliances included at the ticket price of 35 million HUF ( about $124.000). Maybe this sounds too low, but if you are not looking for a home in the capital area it is pretty realistic.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1323" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/new_home.jpg" alt="New Home" width="640" height="411"></p>
<h3>The first</h3>
<p>They decide to use all the &#8220;free&#8221; money on the purchase and they happily move in. By the time the paybacks start to kick in it is about the time their first child is born. Thus the payback of the personal loan gets suspended for three years.</p>
<p>They only have to start paying back the 15 million mortgage which means a monthly payment of about $300. This beats the available rents in the area so they are already very happy. I am sure this would make even getting used to sleep-deprivation easier <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><em>Personal loan amount: 10 million (payback suspended for 3 years)</em></p>
<p><em>Mortgage amount: 15 million ($300 monthly payment)</em></p>
<h3>The second</h3>
<p>Fast forward two years, they paid back 25 monthly payments reducing the mortgage amount with about 2 million ($7500). They discover that the wife is expecting a baby again. Nine months later she gives birth to their second child.</p>
<p>Both their family and financial life gets enlightened. The personal loan payback gets suspended for another three years, moreover, the loan amount gets reduced by 30%.</p>
<p>Through another grant at the time of the birth of their second child 1 million HUF gets deducted from the mortgage amount.</p>
<p><em>Personal loan amount: 7 million&nbsp;(payback suspended for 3 years)</em></p>
<p><em>Mortgage amount: 12 million ($300 monthly payment)</em></p>
<h3>The third</h3>
<p>The kids are growing fast. Our couple is about to celebrate the fifth and second birthdays of their kids when they learn that they are expecting a baby again. Nine months later happiness is all over the place when their third cute and perfectly healthy baby sees the light of the sun.</p>
<p>The government is exceptionally happy too as the demographic numbers are getting better and better so they pour the last round of grants on them. The personal loan gets erased in its wholeness.</p>
<p>The 10 million grant is secured and they are getting another deduction on their mortgage amount. This time the amount is 4 million. Through the last two years they paid back 2 million again so this amount gets deducted from the remaining 10 million.</p>
<p><em>Personal loan amount: 0 (entirely forgiven)</em></p>
<p><em>Mortgage amount: 6 million ($300 monthly payment)</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1324" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/three_kids.jpg" alt="Three kids" width="640" height="427"></p>
<h3>Killing it</h3>
<p>At this point, we can assume that if they were saving and investing in the past ten years they could kill the remaining mortgage in a blink of an eye. Same time the interest rate is pretty low so looking on just the numbers, it is probably a better idea to keep saving and investing and just paying off the mortgage in the next ten years using the proceeds.</p>
<p>Also worth mentioning that after&nbsp;living in the house for ten years they are allowed to sell it (capital gain tax-free), pay off the rest of the mortgage and cash out if they decide so. Taking a hypothetical 3% appreciation into account they could probably sell the home for about 47 million. Let&#8217;s deduct 6 million for killing the mortgage and another 1 million for the expenses. They will end up at 40 million HUFs, almost $142k in the bank versus the $36k they paid back.</p>
<h3>Let&#8217;s ride</h3>
<p>I have to add that a family of five has its needs. For example, one could be a car which is big enough to carry around all of them with their stuff. Luckily, the government got your back again.</p>
<p>For a family with three kids, they throw at you another non-refundable grant of 2.5 million HUFs in case you buy a brand new car which has at least seven seats. Let&#8217;s pick the cheapest solution and go with the not very appealing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacia_Lodgy">Dacia Lodgy</a>. But hey, a car is a car, am I right? It gets you from point A to point B. Who cares how does it look like?</p>
<p>The list price for that monster is around 3.5 million HUFs. That means they only have to save up 1 million ($3.550) to have a brand new car. Sounds good, right?</p>
<h3>Closing words</h3>
<p>Of course, this is a best-case scenario. Most of the times life happen on the way.&nbsp;Still, it is a good example of how can one family kickstart their life by obtaining a $124k home for less than one-third of the ticket price and max out the benefits the government offers them legally.</p>
<p>You could say that &#8220;Yeah, sounds good, but those kids cost money too&#8221;. Well, that is true but you probably would not make such a choice based only on the benefits. Or at least I would not. So, I assume our lovely couple could afford to raise them anyway. One of the biggest expenses, education could be free in Hungary after all. Also, there are other grants a family could get but those are out of the scope of this already long post.</p>
<p><em>Hope you enjoyed this little thought experiment. Does your government offer something similar? Are they crazy? Would you take advantage of such benefits? Would it trick you into having more kids than you should have? What are your thoughts?</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I cannot resist kicking off this post and this year with a quote.</p>
<blockquote><p>“So many books, so little time.”<br />
―&nbsp;<span class="authorOrTitle">Frank Zappa</span></p></blockquote>
<p>This little quote sums up pretty much my recent years. I love reading books but I have to admit that in the past two years I consumed written content mostly in form of blog posts. I am not a fan of <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wrapping-up-the-year-with-gratitude/">new years resolutions</a> so the decision that in 2019 I want to read more actual books is more of a plan. When I saw that one of the first bloggers I started to follow wrote a book and offering a copy for review I knew that I will take the challenge to write my first book review. Enjoy.</p>
<h3>The Proven Path To All The Money You Will Ever Need</h3>
<p>I think that I don&#8217;t really have to introduce <a href="https://twitter.com/sabatier">Grant Sabatier</a> from <a href="https://millennialmoney.com/">MillennialMoney.com</a> to anyone who spent a couple of months in the personal finance blogosphere&#8230; Still, if you don&#8217;t know him yet, don&#8217;t worry, he is starting the book by introducing you to his story. Despite he followed the proven path of the previous generations (go&nbsp;to good schools, learn well, get good grades, etc.) somehow still ended up broke moving back to his parents&#8217; home. But unlike many other folks, this situation did not push him into the abyss of self-pity and desperation but invoked a thought process which resulted in crossing the finish line of being financially independent&nbsp;five years later. I will not spoiler the details here, give the book a chance, definitely worth a read.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1295" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/financialFreedom_book-858x1024.png" alt="Financial Freedom Book" width="468" height="558"></p>
<h3>Who should read this book?</h3>
<p>I would state that everyone who wants to improve his/her financial future but I have to admit that for some reading it would be more important. The main target audience and the ones who need to hear these things the most are millennials in their twenties and thirties who are just at the beginning of their financial journey. It is not the case that older, family folks, like myself, will not find any valuable ideas (spoiler alert: you will) but that age group is the one I think can profit the most from getting familiar with the content of this book. Sneakers and wantrepreneurs, you should also read this book from cover to cover <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>What is the book about after all?</h3>
<p>Well, it is about financial freedom, and financial freedom is about getting back your time and freedom. If I had to summarize it in one sentence I would say:</p>
<blockquote><p>This book is a blueprint, made of all kind of essential financial wisdom, glued together with Grants story and financial journey and infused by a true millennial mindset.</p></blockquote>
<p>The book begins with the statement that &#8220;Money is freedom&#8221; and introducing the authors&#8217; background and epiphany. Then he goes on explaining why should we all participate in the chasing of our freedom through reaching financial freedom.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we start to get involved, and in our first task Grant shows how to calculate our number which would mark the finish line. But the goal is not enough, first, we have to investigate where we are standing at the moment. He gives a very detailed framework to analyze our situations and to get a clear picture of our snapshot.</p>
<p>From now on we can dive into our numbers and make a lot of calculations which will deepen our understanding even better. Then he starts to sketch up the possible advancements in the ways we are making (or saving) money. After an introduction to a proper and comfortable budgeting process, we get to the part where we get embraced to stick to our 9-to-5 jobs, maximize the benefits of it and use it as a launching pad to freedom.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1296" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Grant_Sabatier_Laptop-1024x682.jpg" alt="Grant Sabatier Laptop" width="640" height="426"></p>
<p>Next, we are getting educated on how to find, establish and run a successful side hustle to fast track the financial advancement. In the next chapter, he walks us through his 7-step investment strategy which pretty much covers the tidbits any average Joe should know and use. Of course, real estate investing cannot be left out.</p>
<p>When the path is clear and you stick to the progress you finally start to get close to your target. You will find the necessary help in the last two chapters to plan how to use your well deserved accumulated wealth and finally a little eye opener/focus keeper philosophy which will make you understand that while money is important it is the tool, not the goal. When you understand this you will live the &#8220;Rich Life&#8221; you always dreamed of.</p>
<h3>My key takeaways from the book</h3>
<p>It turned out that we are thinking about many things very similarly with Grant, mainly on life philosophy and about <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/my-stuff-evaluation-ruleset/">owning stuff</a>. If you are like me, lurking in the personal finance blogosphere and consuming blog posts on a daily basis, possibly you will be familiar with most of the topics covered in this book. Still, there are messages which cannot be repeated enough times so here are the points I found exceptionally interesting.</p>
<ul>
<li>The relationship between time and money should not be linear. We should learn the &#8220;enterprise mindset&#8221; and apply it to our finances. The sooner you can break that linearity the faster you can reach your financial goals.</li>
<li>The main role of a financial advisor is not to bring stellar return opportunities to you but to prevent you from making the dumbest decisions on the most important fields of your financial life.</li>
<li>The understanding of this simple truth: $1 invested will worth more tomorrow, $1 not invested will&nbsp;worth less. That inflation thing truly ruins everything, still, many folks just ignore it like as it isn&#8217;t existing.</li>
<li>Not meeting budgeting goals can make you feel guilty.&nbsp;Budgeting is a lot like dieting: the more guilt you feel, the less likely you are to stick with it&#8230; (explains why I hate budgeting too)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are possibly many more but these were the ones I cannot resist highlighting <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy fellas!</p>
<p>Long time no see.</p>
<p>As anyone can tell, this second half of the year <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wake-me-up-when-september-ends/">wasn&#8217;t my most productive</a> period in terms of blogging and otherwise. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am not apologizing and have no regrets. Many times I exchanged &#8220;blogging time&#8221; for simply hanging out with my wife or playing late with my daughters. Life is about priorities and we all have the same scarce resource of time which we decide where to invest. After all, I am just one of the <a href="https://indeedably.com/fire-extinguisher">grey pigeons</a> of financial blogging, writing gibberish to random strangers on the interwebz. In some cases, a discussion arises and we get to know each other even more. Sometimes we even get friends. And when this happens it is wonderful.</p>
<p>These days there is a lot of criticism about (financial) bloggers in general and especially about this phenomenon I like to protect, the FIRE movement. Some arguments are legit and some are invalid. I have my opinions but who am I to judge? Perception is a wonderful thing after all <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> All I can do is that I try to be honest with myself and others and stay on the <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/2018/12/14/the-financial-content-creator-ethics-pledge/">righteous&nbsp;side</a>. While I left the consistent publishing schedule far behind (if I ever followed it&#8230;) making all the SEO and blogging gods fretful and probably acquired some bonus points on the &#8220;worlds worst blogger&#8221; contest, I really wanted to publish something meaningful as the closing post of this year.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1243" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1243" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1243 size-large" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/gandalf-1024x576.jpg" alt="Gandalf" width="640" height="360"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1243" class="wp-caption-text">Wisdom is always welcome from trustable sources</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t run away I will not pull out my red pencils and count the achieved and failed blogging goals for the year. Neither will I introduce you to the secret five-point&nbsp;list which will bring you the ultimate new-year-resolution-maker-goal-setting-process. In a <a href="https://indeedably.com/fire-extinguisher/#comment-337">recent&nbsp;discussion</a>, I stated that &#8220;the best things what you can earn in this community is friendship and knowledge I think&#8221;. Then somehow the long discontinued <a href="https://www.1500days.com/category/gratitude/">Gratitude series on 1500days.com</a>&nbsp;popped into my mind and I&nbsp;thought that I will combine these two thoughts and wrap up the year with a gratitude post.</p>
<p>I believe in the power of words and I love when I get introduced to new (or at least new to me) words or expressions. For one of these words, I am grateful to a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/the-falcon-method">fellow Hungarian investor, David</a>. I learned a lot of other things but one of my favorite expressions also came from him. It is &#8220;selective contrarian&#8221;. It is widely used in investment terms but I think you can also use it for your overall outlook on the world. When I spend my time as not a creator but a consumer of content (most of the time) I always searching for such unique voices in the big mass of ideas, teachings, and preachings. Every now and then I find one.&nbsp;And when this happens it is wonderful.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to say goodbye to this blogging year by expressing my gratitude to all the folks who are kind to my heart and enriched my life on a way. Their contributions are sometimes ideas I found interesting, entertaining or educating. These brought me smiles, improved my thinking or even drove my financial decisions. And in some rare cases, the ideas brought me epiphanies or left me seriously thinking about my life and my future. While the former is&nbsp;important too&nbsp;the revelations brought by the latter are game changers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1241" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/real_mvp.jpg" alt="you da real mvp" width="250" height="250"></p>
<p>Without any further ado let me introduce you to the voices and ideas which contributed most to my mindset this year. The list is probably not complete and there is no importancy, alphabetical or other ranking, just the order they pop into my mind.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com">J$</a></h3>
<p>Let’s kick off the list with a true rockstar. To be honest I never expected that when you ping a top blogger he will actually answer. But Jay did. Every. Single. Time. With a joking tone one-liner or a longer description if I asked something. And sometimes with a much-needed encouragement.</p>
<p>In terms of wisdom, I can point my finger on two things.</p>
<p>One is that sometimes you have to “Let It Go”. Even if that is a big project which was built by yourself from scratch. It does not matter how much you want to keep it if it keeps you away from things which are most important to you it is time to say farewell.</p>
<p>The other thing is his weirdo <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/why-im-obsessed-with-cemeteries/">obsession with cemeteries</a>. While I don’t totally share this emotion I can relate to the feeling and nothing puts your life more into perspective than facing your mortality and remembering that <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/deadly-finance/">sooner or later the road will come to an end</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.1500days.com">Mr.1500</a></h3>
<p>Carl is another awesome guy, whom I also thought is out of my reach but interestingly he replied to my emails every now and then. I cannot really point on a single idea of his but his story as it flows gives me inspiration. And peace. There are dozens of posts out there about the fear of retiring because folks just don’t know what to do with their life. Carl’s post-retirement life is the living example that I should not worry. He kept coding, he improved his health and did all kind of fun and <a href="https://www.1500days.com/i-left-my-job-one-year-ago-heres-how-its-going/">cool stuff with his family</a>. Let’s talk about mapping fulfilling future&#8230;</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.keepthrifty.com">Chris Durheim</a></h3>
<p>Chris is also a programmer and a fellow father with daughters. You see a pattern here? Yeah, I like to search for like-minded folks, let’s go on. So, Chris took a one-year mini-retirement and then extended it. Most of the times you read only the good about such stories. But where is the bad and the ugly? Well, Chris had to realize that it is not always <a href="https://www.keepthrifty.com/mini-retirement-mental-breakdown/">rainbows and unicorns</a>. But still, the take-home message is that if you go beyond your comfort zone you can find personal growth even if you <a href="https://www.keepthrifty.com/financial-failure-personal-success/">fail on a way or succeed on another</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://othalafehu.com">OthalaFehu</a></h3>
<p>If you would ask me to point my finger on a true badass in the community I would pick him. His posts are not long winded so I will try to wrap up his wisdom the same way:</p>
<p><a href="https://othalafehu.com/tales-crimeside/">Change is possible</a>,<br />
<a href="https://othalafehu.com/personal-story/">Discipline is important</a>,<br />
<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/prepping-for-non-preppers-101/">Preparedness is golden</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org">ChiefMomOfficer</a></h3>
<p>Liz is an incredible person, a true energy bomb. Sometimes I start being suspicious if she had a secret interview with Hermione Granger for her <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/women-on-fire/">Woman On Fire</a> series but she never published it to keep the fact in secret that she passed on that <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Time-Turner">time turner</a> to her so she can have more than 24 hours a day. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> She published dozens of educative posts but the one which is closest to my heart tells the <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/2017/03/06/going-into-crisis-mode-when-it-all-goes-to-hell-a-story-of/">story of their fight with death</a>. Yeah, sometimes it is sobering to remember that bad things can happen with good people so having an emergency fund and a plan B at hand is always a good idea.</p>
<h3><a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Groovy</a></h3>
<p>As I told you I like learning new expressions and the <a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/am-i-about-to-become-a-teat-sucking-layabout/">“teat sucking layabout”</a> could be the expression of the year. But there is more wisdom here than a geniusly fabricated expression. The biggest lesson for me in their story is that you can be different. You can take <a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/the-broken-windows-of-personal-finance/">ownership of your stuff</a> and you can change things if you really want. Mr. Groovy worked a government job for a long time, despite we share a similar disgust about how they are running their(?) business. He was able to make a difference just by changing his mindset, taking over control and improve himself. As a result, they enjoy post-retirement life in a location of their choice in a home they built recently. &#8220;<a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/not-lazy-slob/">Don’t embrace the sloth</a>&#8221; is huge take-home message here.</p>
<h3><a href="https://mysterymoneyman.com">MisteryMoneyMan</a></h3>
<p>MisteryMoneyMan is the other MMM whose posts I like to read. I am also a follower of his insider email series where he shares his adventures as a hustler. While I am collecting the ideas from his reportings the reason why I added him to the list is an act which is not so common, even in the FIRE community. Recently, instead of rushing on the good old corporate ladder he just <a href="https://mysterymoneyman.com/why-im-climbing-down-the-corporate-ladder/">simply climbed down a little</a> to regain some of his time and freedom. I am not working in such a hierarchy where this would be something I could do, but the idea of giving up a bigger opportunity for the greater good is something I want to keep in mind just in case a situation will ever arise. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/">AbandonedCubicle</a></h3>
<p>Cubert is a true joker, I always like to read his writings but despite he is playing with FIRE recently the area he widened my view is real estate. He owns some <a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/category/build-wealth-with-rental-properties/">rental properties</a> which he renovated mostly by himself and running an <a href="https://www.abandonedcubicle.com/airbnb-experiment/">experiment with Airbnb</a>. These are topics which are picking my mind because of future investment possibilities so it is good to have insights on how others solve issues and share their raw numbers.</p>
<h3><a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/">CheesyFinance</a></h3>
<p>Mr. CF is a cheerful guy and I really like his original ideas and thought experiments. The “<a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/category/should-you/">should you buy a…</a>” series brought his name to this list. The idea of actually <a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/2018/08/06/should-you-buy-a-yacht/">buying a boat</a> never crossed my mind (there aren’t many wooden pirate ships out there for a reasonable price) but I have to admit that <a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/2018/08/27/should-you-buy-a-castle/">buying (or building) a castle</a> did and his numbers in this post confirm that it is not absolute insanity (like my wife thinks). An <a href="https://cheesyfinance.nl/2018/09/06/should-you-buy-an-island/">island would be</a> an equally awesome thing but the financial rationality wasn’t really backed by the numbers. We have some more work to do here <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/">WhatLifeCouldBe</a></h3>
<p>Mr. &amp; Mrs. White (and their kids) are charming people. The types you sit down with for the first time and five minutes later you are having a conversation like if you know each other for ages. After I discovered the European FIRE scene through <a href="https://firehub.eu/">FIREHub.eu</a> and read about <a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2015/10/07/about-us/">their life</a> on their blog they were the first people I was speaking with in real life via Skype. When it turned out that I cannot attend the <a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/tag/fiwe/">FIWE</a>, their annual conference we agreed that we will meet sometime in person as we are living only one border away. This happened this summer and we spent a wonderful day chatting, biking, walking around, having a nice lunch and some drinks. The kids also had a great time and I am looking forward to repeating the occasion sometime next year.</p>
<p>Besides this great experience, I wanted to emphasize Mr. Ws&#8217; incredible mindset about handling obstacles. He <a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2018/09/25/i-want-to-change-the-world/">believes in making a difference</a> and that it can be started on a small scale, locally. I am always impressed when I read about <a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2018/11/21/talking-personal-finance-poor-mums/">such endeavors</a> of his. He is the living example for the saying “when there’s a will there’s a way”. We should all learn that letting our priorities drive our lives and fighting passivity are some of the best places we could invest our times.</p>
<h3><a href="https://retireinprogress.com/">RetireInProgress</a></h3>
<p>I discovered Mr. RIPs&#8217; blog earlier this year and at first, I have only read some of the latest posts. His writing style and humor caught me and I started to dig deeper. That&#8217;s how I found out about <a href="http://retireinprogress.com/category/mystory/">his origin story</a> and it blew my mind. A life packed with challenges, struggles, victories, dreams achieved and left behind. The very important lesson is that even reaching to the top, getting many coders <a href="http://retireinprogress.com/mystory7/">dream job</a> does not automatically skyrockets you to lalaland and when the magic starts to vanish you realize the golden handcuffs on your wrist. His approach to dream, work for it, test and dump it if you don’t enjoy it anymore is something more of us should adopt.</p>
<h3><a href="https://indeedably.com">{in·deed·a·bly}</a></h3>
<p>The biggest lesson here: don&#8217;t use Google when someone <a href="https://indeedably.com/normalcy/">told you so</a>… Jokes apart, {in·deed·a·bly} is a late discovery but instantly jumped to the top of my favorite list. He is one of the few bloggers who excels in storytelling and using it to make his posts more colorful. It is not just the appealing design of his blog but a very unique perspective is what sucked me into binge reading his posts. Hard to pick a single best one, I haven’t found any which isn’t inspiring, educating, entertaining or the combination of these. Maybe the most thought-provoking is which provides the framework for <a href="https://indeedably.com/financial-planning/">financial planning</a> and the funniest is the story about the <a href="https://indeedably.com/subversion/">creativity of his kids</a>. Looking forward to consuming more delicious thought food of his in the future.</p>
<h3><a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/">EarlyRetirementDude</a></h3>
<p>I had a professor back at the university teaching us Calculus I. He was a mean guy with an individual sense of humor. He was trolling us all the time and joking on our unpreparedness. I became a drop-out for the first time because of his class. But I started over and tried again. I passed his exam for the 10th time with a lot of effort and help from others. Then next year came Calculus II and he became not just the professor but the lecturer also. After a couple of lessons, I realized that I was totally wrong about him in the previous years. He wasn’t the douchebag we thought he is but we were the idiots who did not take life seriously enough. He just had a particular way of mocking us and trying to make us face with the harsh truth that we should stop whining and start working harder if we want to achieve our goals. Looking back now he may have been one of the best teachers I ever had.</p>
<p>The reason I started this introduction with this flashback is that after I started reading ER Dudes’ posts I felt the same. At first, I thought that this is an extremely smart grumpy guy who spreads his wisdom with a pinch of sarcasm all the time. Then I realized that he is just an extremely smart and extremely honest guy who shoots his wisdom towards you without a single sprinkle of bullshit. He taught me many valuable lessons about the <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/the-history-of-fier/">origins of the FI/ER movement</a> or the true <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/summary-tuesdays-reddit-interview-inventor-4-rule/">nature of the 4% rule</a>. Still, there was <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/early-retirement-expectations-unrealistic-probably-wrong/">one thought</a> which made a huge impact on my thinking and made me look at my job through a completely different set of lenses. Please read the quote and there will be no need for further explanation.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Your job’s a business transaction. You may want to sell your time to these people and they may want to buy it from you…so when you feel desperate for the door &#8211; really desperate &#8211; remember: if you want your freedom that badly, the door’s right there. Nobody’s hiding the keys. All else is a matter of compromise.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The interesting thing is that this single quote freed me up from worry. It gave a joker card in my hand. Maybe you would expect that as a result, I turned in my notice. Actually, what happened is quite the opposite. I enjoy my job more than ever. I took ownership of my stuff and I am not just drifting anymore but dictating the direction and don’t shy away anymore from saying out loud what I am thinking. When you realize that the door is actually there, you can leave whenever you want, nobody’s hiding the keys and nobody’s holding you back you will experience freedom. It is like having the FU money… except I don’t have that FU money but I know that I could find another job or I could indulge in entrepreneurship and still would be able to provide to my family. In a way I guess, this is similar to the freedom of after FIRE life.</p>
<h3><a href="https://financial-independence.eu/">Financial Independence Europe podcast</a></h3>
<p>Last but not least I wanted to add the one and only podcast to the list which I was able to stick with. I have to admit that I am not a podcast listener. I rarely do activities which makes a great fit with podcast listening. Tried to follow some in the past but until now there wasn&#8217;t a single one which was able to get me listening episode after episode. I cannot really emphasize a single piece of wisdom as all the episodes are interesting on a way. So, thank you <a href="https://financiallymint.com/">Araminta</a>, Matthias, and Alvar for treating us with many fresh ideas and perspectives. I see a big potential in reaching your goals with the podcast.</p>

<p><em>It is almost sure that I have left out someone or something. When it will hit me I will come back and update this post, but for now, my dear reader, this is it. Hope you found something which is interesting, entertaining or educating for you too. And if you are anything like me, maybe you had some epiphanies too.</em></p>
<p><em>With this, I want to thank you all for reading my silly think soups this year. Wishing you all a very Happy New Year and I hope the discoveries, on both side, will continue next year.</em></p>
<p><em>Take care!</em></p>

The truth is that this series takes place in a special corner of my heart and I don&#8217;t really plan on killing it before I stop blogging, so please calm down.&nbsp;</i>Today I brought you another fellow European and London based blogger who shied away so far from talking about the topic of programming in detail on his blog, however, he is one with the most advanced programming skills amongst us. </em><em>Enjoy!</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Greetings to all my imaginary friends on the internet! I am the man behind the pseudonym { in·deed·a·bly }, who publishes random thoughts at <a href="https://indeedably.com">indeedably.com</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us a nerdy secret if you have one</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I wrote the original real-time SMS vote counting algorithm used by several reality television shows.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some enterprising guys on my team monitored the incoming results, then dashed down to the bookmakers just before voting closed to bet on the outcome.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They didn’t win, learning an expensive lesson that reality television shows are scripted!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I was about 7 years old, my father came home carrying an enormous box containing a computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He plugged it into the television and powered it up, then sat there staring expectantly at the blinking cursor with a puzzled expression on his face… waiting for something to happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It quickly became apparent he had absolutely no idea what to do next!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The following day he bought a copy of a computer magazine called Zap from the local newsagent. It came with an insert containing the code listing for a game called Aztec Challenge.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1220 size-full" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ActecChallenge_Animation.gif" alt="ActecChallenge" width="384" height="272"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This was years before the World Wide Web was a glimmer in Tim Berners-Lee’s eye. Back then if you wanted to play a game, you first had to type in the source code!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My father valiantly tried to key in the pages of incomprehensible hexadecimal source code. He quickly became frustrated, deciding that his sausage fingers weren’t designed for “computering”. He parked me in front of the keyboard and proceeded to dictate the source code, giving me a clip over the ear each time the checksum validator beeped an objection to my dubious two finger typing skills.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fortunately, this too quickly became boring. My father stormed out to the shed to play with toys that he did understand&#8230; power tools! I don’t recall him ever attempting to use that computer again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Labouriously I keyed in the remainder of the source code. It took hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Eventually, it was done, and I was able to run the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was magical! From that moment onwards I was hooked on computers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What was your first machine?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A Commodore 64, with a cassette player and a joystick.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1221 size-full" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Commodore_64_with_the_external_power_supply_and_Commodore_1530_C2N_Datasette.jpg" alt="Commodore 64" width="800" height="401"></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I quickly became more interested in learning how they worked rather than playing them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I wanted to peek behind the curtain at the code that was executing while a program was running.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To translate the magic into science.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To learn how programs actually performed whatever function they were executing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before long I had taught myself to program in BASIC. Soon I was modifying games to make them better. Eventually, I started writing games of my own.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What about education, was it related to computing, did you learn in a traditional way or something else? What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Near the end of high school, the school I attended acquired a dozen battered old IBM XT clones. They announced they would offer a computing course, re-badged themselves a “technology” school, and begged the local government for additional funding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A very angry English teacher was given the thankless task of trying to teach a bunch of disinterested teenagers how to code. He must have really upset the school principal to be given that assignment!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the first lesson, it quickly became apparent the teacher had never before used a computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By the end of the second lesson, the other students were asking me for assistance debugging their simple “Hello World” programs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Halfway through the third lesson, the teacher gave up and tasked me with running the class.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For the remainder of the school year, I taught the class how to code their own “choose your own adventure” style quest game (including graphics and sound).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The teacher contentedly sat in the corner reading novels by Douglas Adams and Grant Naylor, randomly bursting into thunderous belly laughs that shook the windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At university, I studied Accounting. I took a couple of elective computing classes early on but quickly concluded the impractical way universities teach computing wouldn’t help me get a job.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">My first job was delivering newspapers, aged 10.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I took a second job working in a photo lab, aged 16.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I added a third job working in a bar, aged 18.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My first professional job was as an Accountant, aged 20.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Accounting was great. It paid well! More importantly, it taught me to understand the profit motive and how to identify the value chain. These are valuable life skills that everyone should possess.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Accounting also involved no heavy lifting, working outdoors in the rain, breaking up drunken fights, or developing the random (often bizarre, and occasionally disturbing) photos that people take!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Aged 21, I followed a pretty girl to the United Kingdom on a working holiday visa. There I fell into a freelance developer <a href="https://indeedably.com/fear/">contract</a>, and have been involved in IT ever since.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the beginning, I loved the beauty of an elegantly coded algorithm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In those days memory, storage, and CPU cycles were expensive precious commodities. I learned that program efficiency was paramount, and performance tuning was a superpower.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In time I realized that it really didn’t matter how fast or pretty my code was if the specification I was working to failed to solve the client’s business problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I moved upstream, into analysis and requirements capture.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It turned out that clients often ask for the wrong thing. In these cases, regardless of how faithfully my requirements document captured their request, the resulting solution would solve exactly the wrong problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I moved upstream again, into architecture and later management consulting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now I got involved right at the start, helping clients to differentiate between what they think they want and what they actually need.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This typically involves identifying the strategic goals the client hopes to achieve, then (providing the goal makes sense) determining the optimal way to make it happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">More often than, what is required are people and process focussed changes, that no amount of technical wizardry could ever hope to rectify!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also learned that data is the true lifeblood of an organization, far more important than any individual process or piece of code.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lose or leak too much of it, and the business dies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Corrupt it, and the business experiences a long lingering death from badly informed decision making.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Data lasts forever. It will outlive any of the ever-changing array of transient applications, pipelines and data stores through which it may travel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look after your data as if your life depends on it… because in your business’s case, it really does!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am very fortunate, in that I have passed the point of having “enough”.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tell us about your journey so far?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over the years I have established a diversified set of sustainable <a href="https://indeedably.com/i-own/">passive income streams</a> that now cover the majority of my living expenses.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Several years ago I struck a balance between living for today and planning for tomorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I lead a semi-retired working pattern. During the cold wet London winter months, I usually help clients solve interesting tricky problems. The remainder of the year I enjoy being a man of leisure.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Information Technology provides a wealth of opportunities for those who are willing to take them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">IT remains one of the few remaining professions where there are low barriers to entry, and what you can do matters far more than where you went to school or who you know.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Working initially as a freelancer, and then later running a consultancy, allowed me to dictate the pace of my career progression. I could also charge whatever a client was willing to pay for my time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The flip side of that equation is that every day is a performance evaluation: do well today and you may be welcome back tomorrow. Do poorly and you will quickly find yourself seeking a new client. Competitive pressures and commercial uncertainties are constant threats to your livelihood.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Everyone should learn the basics of coding: algorithm design, control of flow, and decision statements. These are core competencies, similar to having a basic grasp of reading or maths.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, I think people should carefully consider what they desire from life, and where they want to live before they pursue a career as a programmer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are amazingly gifted programmers sat all over the world, each capable of writing beautifully elegant and wonderfully efficient code.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many of them won’t need to earn as much as you to pay their rent.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the quality of output is materially the same, the main differentiator becomes price.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In a race to the bottom, those living in high cost of living locations get priced out of the market first.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The technology game is also brutally Darwinian. Technology trends change at an alarming rate. Hard-won skills and experience can become stale or irrelevant after a dishearteningly short period of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Re-skilling every 2-3 years just to remain employable is not uncommon for programmers. The novelty wears off that particular aspect of coding very quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My recommendation for people interested in a career in technology would be to focus on client-facing roles that cannot be easily outsourced or offshored. Roles that require both business and technology knowledge. These types of roles are also harder to replace with AI.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">When your hobby becomes your job, it quickly starts to feel like work rather than fun!<br />
Once I started coding for a living, I quickly lost all interest in tinkering with personal projects.<br />
That was unfortunate, as previously much of my free time had been devoted to torturing computers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tips for beginners?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Learn coding basics by completing some free/low-cost online courses offered by sites like <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://www.lynda.com/">Lynda.com</a>, and <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Becoming proficient at coding is like becoming proficient at music. Initially, you will be unspeakably bad. With time and a lot of practice, you will improve.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Identify an actual, tangible, problem you are personally experiencing. Now code yourself a solution. And repeat.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Vendor certifications are often an expensive waste of time and money.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you want to pursue a university degree then carefully consider the value of each institution’s brand. Perform an honest cost/benefit analysis on whether the tuition fees are actually worth having that brand on your degree or diploma.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example, the internationally renowned Oxford University and the largely unknown Oxford Brookes University share many student facilities and charge identical tuition fees. Yet one is far more likely to get you a job interview than the other.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Which technology area picks your brain most these days?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BostonDynamics/videos">work Boston Dynamics</a> are doing with robotics is fascinating.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What do you think is the biggest improvement/challenge the IT industry looking forward these days?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are several, but one of the big ones is managing “legacy hell”.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Recent ransomware attacks highlighted the huge number of organizations that depend upon technology platforms long past their useful life. It was alarming to see how much of the economy was held together by nothing more than duct tape and hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Decades of underfunding, shortsighted management decisions, and the absence of sustainable IT strategies have created a major vulnerability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The problem has existed for a long time. The core systems found at the heart of many major institutions still run on 1970s technology, written in arcane languages where the majority of skilled practitioners have long since retired or died of old age.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately, we keep repeating those same mistakes. For example, consider the vast numbers of web-enabled “Internet of Things” devices that ship with no viable means of patching security vulnerabilities.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">You’re still fighting the last war!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Worry about something you can control, like how you will pay the bills once AI begins to program themselves. The majority of programmers become structurally redundant at that point.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><em>Desktop OS:</em> macOS</li>
<li><em>Mobile OS:</em> iOS</li>
<li><em>Machine:</em> Xbox</li>
<li><em>Browser:</em> Chrome</li>
<li><em>Programming language:</em> Visual Basic for Applications… there is nothing Excel can’t do, but an awful lot that it shouldn’t!</li>
<li><em>And the most important… spaces or tabs:</em> gofmt and auto-fixing linters solved this</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Would you write a couple of lines of code to present a simple financial principle?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I would love to… but no.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Years ago my developers staged a mutiny and revoked my access to the tools.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is possible they were intimidated by the sheer awesomeness of the boss’s coding skills…. but unlikely!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They protested that when I was having fun crafting code, I wasn’t doing my day job: lining up new client projects, managing stakeholders, designing high-level solutions, and generally keeping them all gainfully employed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They were probably right. Identifying, and then focusing on, those unique things we can each do to sustainably add value is a sound financial operating principle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are already done with the triduum of <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/who-killed-my-halloween/">Halloween, All Saints&#8217; Day and All Souls’ Day</a>. While the Halloween part got more and more popularity at our ends only in recent years the other two days were always the occasion for us to visit the graves of our loved ones. This melancholic time of the year is perfect for remembering and reflection. As the weather turns colder, the days darker, and nature slowly slips into its hibernated state our thoughts unintentionally shifts towards passing away and dying.</p>
<p>Death is a scary thing and we instinctively try to avoid even thinking about that. At least for most of us. I don’t know what has changed lately, maybe this comes with age (or maybe, as I hope, wisdom) but I am no more in that camp. I got used to thinking about death and in a strange way it calms me. Accepting that it is the law of nature, that all living things will unavoidably die at some point, in a strange way, provides me with a peace of mind. Just as thinking about the many different ways this could happen.</p>
<p>Maybe it is just the logical thinker in me but it calms me the same way as knowing that I have handled all the possible outcomes while writing computer code. While life is much more complicated than the average software it does not hurt if we build into our program a proper way of error handling. Trust me it is a very shitty thing when while running a program something goes south and when you are debugging the code and find the error all you see is a long forgotten comment /* TODO &#8211; error handling */. This is not something you want to leave as a legacy for your loved ones once the source code of your body throws an exception and enters into an infinite loop of noop().</p>
<p>Apologies, I went a little bit too nerdy, it happens every now and then. What I wanted to say is that despite it could be uncomfortable and scary, thinking about the inevitable and preparing for it properly is a must do for all of us (especially financially). Let’s face with those scenarios and draw at least a sketchy plan for handling them.</p>
<p>So what if you would die…</p>
<h2>Today</h2>
<p>Ok, now you may ask why do we start with the worst case scenario? Well, because in chronological order this is the first possible option (and maybe you will understand that this is not the worst case after all). Also this the most important scenario to prepare for especially if you leave behind some humans who are count on you. As <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/things-that-are-scarier-than-halloween/#comment-272623">someone pointed out recently</a>, financial dependence is a scary thing (yes, even more than clowns). If you are one of the two or the only breadwinner in the family, like myself, you should not understate this situation. Just ask yourself, if you would stop breathing right after you finish this sentence will your loved ones be covered and set financially to get through the unimaginably hard task of moving on with their lives?</p>
<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Put the time and effort into learning about your insurance options and shop for proper insurance applicable for your situation (term life, salary, etc… but no whole life, at least for me)!</p></blockquote>
<p>This is something I keep asking myself lately and the answer still disturbs me. Three years ago when this question started to pop up (alongside with the curiosity about retirement funding and investments) the answer came in the form of an insurance agent. One consultation and some signatures later I became the responsible, proud, and smart owner of a “whole&#8221; life policy. I was convinced that this is the financial holy grail as it not just provides you with life insurance but also accumulates “investments” and will pay you back every cent plus a “healthy&#8221; profit if you survive the contracted 30 years. I was happy with that for a while but then discovered the personal finance blogosphere and everything changed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1180" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/not_today-1.jpg" alt="Not today" width="500" height="281"></p>
<p>Now I understand how naive I was and what is the price I paid for it. So I did what anyone else would do in my situation, procrastinated the decision for another year. But as we are getting closer to the next payment of the annual premium, I finally forced myself to review this thing, put the numbers on paper and make a responsible decision. So I put together a spreadsheet with all the info, tailored some formulas and drew the lessons from the numbers.</p>
<p>Long story short, the conclusion was that as an investment it performs awfully and as an insurance, it is pretty expensive compared to the coverage it provides. I had no clue about planning for the future and possible investment vehicles back then. According to the numbers, the best case scenario where I survive the contract and get a payout the accumulated amount would be damaged by roughly 50% erosion in buying power. Also if meanwhile shit would hit the fan the payout would barely cover two years of expenses for my family left without a breadwinner&#8230; forever.</p>
<p>So, now I am shopping for a proper term life insurance and about to break that previous contract. It will mean that I will lose the first two years premium but still less than what I would lose if I keep at paying through the thirty year period. In terms of investments, I also will take the control into my hand <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> An expensive lesson but definitely an important one.</p>
<h2>Soon</h2>
<p>See, I told you that maybe today is not the worst possible scenario. I would not go into the details how would it be possible, let&#8217;s just assume you have a crystal ball and you know for sure that you have a couple of months/years left until a specific date when you will kick the bucket with a 100% confidence. Having the insurance topic, mentioned in the previous paragraphs, already handled what should you do in such a situation?</p>
<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Put your efforts into fixing anything you can and into leaving an intellectual and financial legacy which will remain here as a guide for the future!</p></blockquote>
<p>If I have learned something from such real life and fictional (books, movies) situations it is that after you accept the inevitable (finally) and the initial panic will flush away you will get a brutal clarity about what is important to you in life and what is not. Personally, I have never been in such a situation and I hope that I never will but I assume my focus would narrow around my family and their future.</p>
<p>We had a discussion about this with J$ and we agreed that both of us would start to write letters to our loved ones about our thoughts on any situation we think it would be important to the person to hear them. A letter for my daughters to help them get over the first love-sorrow or to express how proud I am at a future success moment. Another for my wife to remind herself the happy moments on nights when she feels so lonely without me. I think writing these would be a time well spent. I would spend as much time with them as I can and write these letters while they are sleeping (“<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431308/">PS I love you</a>” style).</p>
<p>On the financial field, your best guess should not be any less. Try to figure out how could you ensure their financial stability in the future. Also, you should not only create a plan and put it into work, but you also have to teach them how to maintain the system and keep it running when you won’t be there. Moreover, you could leave references and point them towards the sources you were inspired and instructed by. And last but not least encourage them to not only take your words blindly but do their own research, understand the principles, build upon them and get even better than you ever were. After all, this is what we all wish to our kids, aren’t we?</p>
<h2>On time</h2>
<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Reach FIRE asap to free your time</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an ambiguous description but you will get it when you read further. By &#8220;on time&#8221; I mean in case your life goes on like the average and your final hour come around the expected age of yours. How could you know when will it be? If you Google it, you can find out that the current life expectancy is 76 for man and 81 for women. My reaction when I read about a new actual number somewhere always was “hurray, we are living longer again&#8221;. Only recently found out that it only applies to someone who borns now and we have to search for our stats a little bit differently.</p>
<p>You can find a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html">table here</a> where you can look up your numbers or if you prefer <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/population/longevity.html">calculators here</a> is one for the same purpose. It tells me that as a 34 years old male I could expect living another 48 years and my target year could be around 82. I am kind of comfortable with this estimation, I have seen some fellas with that age and it seemed to me that they were pretty satisfied with their lives and what they have achieved.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1185 size-full" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/old_couple-e1541139119669.jpg" alt="Old couple" width="500" height="466"></p>
<p>By that time you should have applied the insurance advice from the &#8220;Today&#8221; part through the past years and maybe you did the exercises from the “Soon” part, even if it did not happen. This option is when our beloved FIRE community enters the big picture, as this is the scenario where your main focus should be reaching FIRE asap. The sooner you get there the more years will you have left for doing whatever your heart desires. Maybe I am biased on this topic and I accept that this is not the only way of living a successful life but I honestly think that this should be the basic goal for everyone.</p>
<h2>Much later</h2>
<p>There is another factor what we did not take into account in the previous scenario. According to the historical life expectancy numbers, we can observe an annual rise in the expected age by 0.2 years. This addition alone would add 9.6 years to my 82 years expectation, but there is more. This rise is caused by the improving standards of living for the population alongside with the development of medicine and science. And because of the huge amount of resources and effort channeling into these fields, it is very likely that even this rise will accelerate in the future. Besides these improvements, humans started to become more conscious about their health and the environment. We still have a long way to go on these fields but this can also boost that acceleration as many top death causes are connected with our own bad habits or pollution in general.</p>

<p>What impressed me is that if you make a little bit of research you can find hundreds of ideas of the possibilities here about future life expectancy, ranging from 100 to over 200 years. Please note that many of these estimations are not originating from some science fiction movies but from legit scientists. If you think of it how many things became a reality for today which was pretty wild dreams in the last century, and even some folks were burned for such ideas a couple of centuries earlier, these numbers aren’t that insane. In my opinion, this is a possible future scenario for the humankind and I hope that this will actually happen.</p>
<p>Same time, despite the benefits of prolonged lifespans, a whole new variety of problems will arise. First of all, I am pretty sure there will be a huge debate if the whole process is morally right or not. Prolonging our lives beyond the natural range isn’t the phenomenon we call &#8220;playing God”? Or this is just the next step of the evolution of the humankind and this possibility always was there encoded into our DNA just the circumstances weren’t optimal? The answers for these questions will come from smarter folks than me. Also, the increased population will have huge requirements of resources but I hope that amongst the increased number of humans there will be even more geniuses living a much longer life to reach breakthroughs and they will solve these problems.</p>

<p>Last but not least there is the question our financially nerdy minds would ask, how will this affect the economy, the financial system, and our beloved personal finances. Today the 4% rule is the gold standard but some folks are already more conservative with withdrawal rates. Some even say that a longer life is a big threat for a happily funded retirement but this is a problem everyone would welcome I think. So what if we start from today&#8217;s principles but we have to plan not for only a couple of decades of retirement but a century or more? I think that the definite goal, in this case, would be reaching the ideal withdrawal rate via the “Never Touch Your Principal” method. Sam wrote a good article about calculating that number <a href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/the-ideal-withdrawal-rate-for-retirement-doesnt-touch-principal/">at Financial Samurai</a>, according to his reasoning you should aim for 2.2-2.8% WR. This would change our worshipped 25x number to 40-50x in terms of nest egg accumulation. The good news is that with a prolonged life you will potentially have much more time for that accumulation phase.</p>
<p>Maybe Suze Orman has some oracle-like skills and that’s why she is echoing the 70 years barrier? By our current numbers the traditional retirement age is at two-thirds of a person&#8217;s life, early retirement age is somewhere under that but at least at the one-third mark. So if we extrapolate that to a prolonged life (and assuming that aging will slow down accordingly) when life expectancy will hit 210 years the old school retirement age would reach 140 years of age. It would be really funny to see them joking on future FIREfolks.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So here you have it, my complete life-ending scenario list. This is the first time I walked through even myself on all possibilities chronologically. It even surprised me how different our focus should be in the different scenarios. So if you want to have a bulletproof plan for the future start with preparing for “Today”, then put some thoughts into the “Soon”, set your goal according to “On time” and try to improve that towards the “Much later” case. Start today and if this article helped you secure your financial future buy me a $60 beer sometime in the next century. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><em>What about you? Which scenario is the scariest in your opinion? Which is the most probable? Which is the one you are actually preparing for? Did I miss something? Am I crazy? Will AI have an intelligence explosion by 2060 and erase humanity from the surface of the Blue Planet once and for all? Let me know in the comments and let&#8217;s have a conversation until the end of the time!</em></p>
