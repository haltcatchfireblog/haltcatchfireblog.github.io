<p>This day came earlier than I thought. Today I will finish the Funny Friday series. But don&#8217;t be afraid, memes will not disappear from my blog, just they will be published in a different way. My intent with this change is to maximize fun while minimizing time wastage. So, memes will return to the blog in a new way in January, but to give a proper closing to this series I collected the best of them. Enjoy and come back for more fun next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey All, yes it seems I am still here. To be honest, I was not sure about continuing this Funny Friday series, however, these were the most popular here. It is a little bit hard to compose a whole set of memes and find a topic as most of the time inspiration comes randomly and for a single meme. This will highly impact the future of these series but will tell more about that next week.</p>
<p>This week the situation was the same when I was reading&nbsp;<a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/how-do-you-hide-your-wealth/">How Are You Stealthy With Your Wealthy?</a>&nbsp;form J$. I noted that his post could fill a Funny Friday episode and he&nbsp;gave &#8220;full permission to do so&#8221;. I really liked the article, hiding your wealth is really boosting it under the hood. In the post, there were five bullet points which I want to present here with a meme each, just in reverse&nbsp;order (you will see in the end the reason :)).</p>
<h2>#5. I eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches 4 days a week</h2>
<p>I have no idea about this thing, but many people worship it so it has to be the food of the gods.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-595" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_pbj.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500"></p>
<h2>#4. I live in a 1,100 sq ft place which is literally the smallest house on the block</h2>
<p>This surprised me as this seems a reliable size to me, we are living in a roughly similar sized house. Also, the $2200 monthly rent blew my mind, you could rent a house for a year here (if you find one to let).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-594" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_house.jpg" alt="" width="616" height="462"></p>
<h2>#3. I’ve become a pretty good minimalist</h2>
<p>This is a trick I am using myself, our laptops are the most expensive things in the house. I have a friend and when we were at his place his father told us &#8220;always be sure to lock the doors, otherwise someone could bring in something&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-593" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_santa.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="450"></p>
<h2>#2. My clothes are riddled with holes</h2>
<p>I am guilty of this too, however, my wife always has an eye on my clothes while doing the laundry. This means that every now and then some hole riddled piece miraculously&nbsp;get lost. Needless to say not my relique clothes which are the only leftovers of my teenage years. Dumping my band name (not brand name) hoodies would be a straight case of divorce.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-592" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_holes.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="356"></p>
<h2>#1. I rock a mohawk</h2>
<p>This point needs no comment. Honestly, I think everybody deserves to have a mohawk at least once in a lifetime. It would change the perspective of the whole world, trust me or just ask Jim from <a href="https://www.routetoretire.com/first-24-hours-j-money-mohawk/">Route To Retire</a>&nbsp;who was brave enough to try it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-591" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_mohawk.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="697"></p>
<p><em>Note: it blew my mind when I found this image. Is it just for me or the similarity is strong with this? I imagine J$ like that when he will be appr. 76 years old and picking the brains of youngsters who question his financial skills because of his hear cut.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s&nbsp;it for now, share with me in the comments if you liked this series. And stay tuned, I will have news about the future next week. Have a Funny Friday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I published my first <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/tuesday-rant-six-figure-problem/">rant post</a> and it became one of the most viewed posts in no time. Of course, I faced some arguments, but fortunately from the good kind.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-564" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_12_most-interesting_man.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Most Interesting Man" width="500" height="627"></p>
<p>While I can accept their points I still stick to my opinion but tried not to be rude.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-563" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_12_not_sure.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Not Sure" width="552" height="414"></p>
<p>Maybe that is because I have seen too many people complaining while their actions didn&#8217;t show any real endeavor to change their situation. The following example is based on true story. If you take smoking into account only as any other luxury habit which eats up 20% of your family budget then, in my opinion, it is a space for cutting back.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-562" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_12_willy_wonka.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Willy Wonka" width="504" height="500"></p>
<p>I have to admit that I am not less guilty living in a modern(?) country than any one of you, but people should really have to learn to live within their means and avoid developing those so-called first world problems.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-561" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_12_first_world_problem.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - First World Problems" width="552" height="367"></p>
<p>A lesson I learned as a coder which is very helpful in any field sounds like the saying &#8220;where there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way&#8221;. If you are not happy with your situation you should research your opportunities instead of just complaining about it and blame it on others.</p>

<p>After all, that is why we are lurking here in this corner of the internet, to learn about earning, saving, investing and avoiding money failures <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>This is an unrelated rant about a recent event I read about. This is a message to companies which are going too far.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you walk in the day of light these days it is inevitable to hear someone talking about <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/the-best-investment-advice/">investing</a> or mining Bitcoins. These mysterious things called cryptocurrencies are around for while, but only recently got into the spotlight that much that next time when you will visit your grandma she will probably asking you about them too. This popularity caused by a recent huge appreciation of Bitcoin, which caused this modern investing fever we have not seen since the 19th century gold rush.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-520" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_ask.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Afraid To Ask" width="490" height="480"></p>
<p>I will not go into details about what Bitcoin is, if you want to know more about this digitally revolutionary thing, then please check this free video course by <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking/bitcoin/v/bitcoin-what-is-it">Khan Academy</a>. It provides a lot of interesting information about the whole topic, but I think you did not come here for teachings on a Funny Friday, did you?</p>
<p>Then what will be the memes about then? Well, I took my thoughts and opinions on the topic and mixed up with some interesting facts randomly.</p>
<h2>Satoshi Nakamoto</h2>
<p>The person or the group who released the concept are hiding behind the aforementioned name. The real identity of the creator is unknown, however, there are some theories about it. One of them is that this name is a simple mixture of the names of the four tech giants SAmsung, TOSHIba, NAKAmichi and MOTOrola. My only problem with this approach is that if these four giant companies unite forces to create such a thing there is no chance that they would ever be able to keep it in secret. My favorite version is that in the real world the cryptographer, Nick Szabo is the real Satoshi. I have to admit that I am biased on this because he is a fellow Hungarian <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> but he is a real expert on the topic, even Tim Ferris recorded a podcast with him with the title <a href="https://tim.blog/2017/06/04/nick-szabo/">“The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency”</a>. He denies the statement, but I cannot blame him. I would do the same if I had approximately 1 million Bitcoins which worths ten billion dollars at current value.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Investing</h2>
<p>In the recent years, but especially in this year a hundreds of posts were published on the topic of Bitcoin investing. However it sounds legit for the everyday people the proud members of our community knows exactly that this is pure speculation. Of course despite this fact it can be very profitable as the change in the price of one BTC from the beginnings exceeds 200.000%. Not a bad ROI, huh?</p>

<h2>The Most Expensive Pizza Ever</h2>
<p>The first documented purchase of a good with Bitcoin was made by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Laszlo_Hanyecz">Laszlo Hanyecz</a>. He bought two Domino&#8217;s pizzas for the astonishing amount of 10.000 BTC on May 17, 2010. On todays value it would be almost $10M, hope the restaurant was wise enough to keep them. To commemorate the transaction, May 22 became the&nbsp;Bitcoin Pizza Day.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Mining</h2>
<p>Bitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger. Anyone with internet connection and proper hardware can participate, but there are giant corporations who are dominating the crypto mining world. There are huge factory buildings in China stuffed with computer parts, running all the time and make their owners wealthier and wealthier every single minute.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-525" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_mine.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="666"></p>
<h2>What Is The Future</h2>
<p>As they say &#8220;No one can predict the future&#8221;. Some say this crypto thing is just another bubble which will burst soon. Others are fanatically putting all their money into it. Who will be right in the end? Who knows. The opponents say that these &#8220;coins&#8221; has no intrinsic value. The advocates say that it has the same attributes as real gold and it will bring the digital revolution to our world. Personally, I think that both sides are right. In terms of profitability and price appreciation I think the hype is strong with this one and sooner or later the bubble will burst. On the other hand, the technology, especially the newer improved variations, like Ethereum and many others are very promising and I believe that it will bring some kind of tech revolution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago I noticed on twitter that people started to talk about buying meat and making sauce and holiday spending (yes I am talking about you J$ and Justin). At first, I got confused because there is a couple of weeks left until Christmas shopping kicks in. The from other comments I realized that I am an idiot, there will come be Thanksgiving and Black Friday soon in the US.</p>
<p>Similarly to <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/who-killed-my-halloween/">Halloween</a>, this is not a holiday we celebrate here in my homeland. Of course, I know from my childhood television consumption that it has to do something with settlers, indians and turkeys. To my excuse, this happening was presented to me by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VbYZDohsHk">Wednesday Addams</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-458" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_wednesday.gif" alt="Funny-Friday-Wednesday" width="500" height="250"></p>
<p>A couple of years ago the commercial infection brought us the Black Friday too (totally unrelated to the above). While in Serbia we cannot talk about an epidemic , the spread in Hungary is more severe. Just for some strange reason, they hold it a week earlier so it happens today. On this occasion, I dug the net (and my head) for some meme ideas. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Can not think of a better kickstart for any topic than the good old Ned.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-469" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_ned_stark.jpg" alt="" width="622" height="477"></p>
<p>On the quest of taking advantage of the Black Friday discount, this was me today.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-468" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_bad_luck_brian.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="562"></p>
<p>Then I came to this conclusion. (Yes, Ned again… I mean Boromir… whatever)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-467" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_boromir.jpg" alt="" width="568" height="335"></p>
<p>Then finally had luck with finding an item which is almost identical to the one I was looking for.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-466" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_success_kid.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>Now that I know about the events over there this question seems relevant.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-465" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_african_kid.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="512"></p>
<p>And similarly to Bad Luck Brian, I would probably have a bitter end if I ever go to Black Friday shopping.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-464" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_most_interesting_man.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="627"></p>
<p>And if still somehow managed to get the last big deal item I would end up like Jack Sparrow (ok, actually that would be kind of cool)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-463" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_jack_sparrow.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"></p>
<p>And there will be trolls as usual, right? (I waited so much to use this meme)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-462" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_insanity_wolf.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>Also Black Friday is great opportunity to train your frugal muscles too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-461" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_advice_duck.jpg" alt="" width="537" height="390"></p>
<p>And finally, let&#8217;s keep one minute silence for the ones who work in stores today.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-460" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_leonidas.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="264"></p>
<p><em>Thats all for today folks. And prepare for your Black Friday. Coming soon.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you probably noticed I am trying to get inspiration from actual events/reads for these <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/funny-friday/">Funny Friday</a> posts. As it turned out you get a lot of different stimulus across the week, so finding a pattern or a theme can be hard sometimes. Honestly, I am thinking hard on dumping the themed editions idea and just fall back to a weekly roundup version. Anyway, what I am sure about that this Funny Friday series will change somehow in the future, just did not get to a decision yet.</p>
<p>Lately read about the positive or negative financial habits of some famous actors, like <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/07/johnny-depp-financial-crisis-money">Johnny Depp</a>, <a href="https://www.thefrugalgene.com/lifestyle-inflation/">Nicolas Cage</a> and Woody Harrelson (will add the link when I find it, I promise). Then I thought I will have a look at their net worths which lead me to <a href="https://www.therichest.com/top-lists/top-100-richest-actors/">this list</a>. It was obvious that I will not create a proper financial meme from all of them, but I chose some of my favorites. I hope you will like them.</p>
<h2>#6 Mel Gibson &#8211; $425M</h2>
<p>He had a lot of great acts, but probably Braveheart was the most memorable. I tried to bring a little bit of actuality for his words though.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-433" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_mel_gibson.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Mel-Gibson" width="413" height="478"></p>
<h2>#8 Sylvester Stallone &#8211; $400M</h2>
<p>Most of the people adore his action movies (cannot blame them, he is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_(film_series)">Rambo</a> after all), others prefer the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_(film_series)">Rocky series</a>. Maybe I am a weirdo, but for me his best movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102603/">Oscar</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-434" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_sylvester_stallone.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Sylvester-Stallone" width="620" height="465"></p>
<h2>#10 Tom Hanks &#8211; $350M</h2>
<p>I devour nearly everything what has a touch from him both as an actor or as a director. I am very picky about war themed movies, but&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185906/">Band of Brothers</a>&nbsp;is definitely one of my favorites and I cannot tell a single film which I was not able to watch having him as an actor.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-431" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_tom_hanks.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Tom-Hanks" width="400" height="270"></p>
<h2>#18 Leonardo DiCaprio &#8211; $245M</h2>
<p>Despite I pigeonholed him after Titanic I have to admit that almost all his movies are great and some of them like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264464/">Catch Me If You Can</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130884/">Shutter Island</a> are epic. Probably another contrarian opinion, but I was not able to watch the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/">Wolf of Wall Street</a>, after a while is started to become a big crying over rich people&#8217;s first world problems.&nbsp;<a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/why-arent-you-stealing-from-the-government/">This post</a> was also an inspiration for this meme, thanks <a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/">Mr. Groovy.</a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-432" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_leonardo_dicaprio.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Leonardo-DiCaprio" width="460" height="288"></p>
<h2>#26 Johnny Depp &#8211; $200M</h2>
<p>You can love him or hate him (or blame him for his questionable money habits) he is a legend and his acting is genious. Deal with it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-430" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_johnny_depp.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Johnny-Depp" width="620" height="413"></p>
<p><em>I plan to keep updating this post in the future to include as many actors as I can from the list. You may ask, why? Well, because I like great movies (who don&#8217;t?) and the research was great fun. So keep an eye on this <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Have a Funny Friday!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&lt;offtopic&gt;This is not connecting to this Funny Friday episode, so you can skip it if you want. Earlier this week I wrote about my <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/who-killed-my-halloween/">relationship with Halloween</a> and that finally, I accepted it. Then it passed by without a single sign. This year I have seen no decorations, except in a supermarket. No kids in costumes wandering the streets and no one rang our bell for trick-or-treating. I was surprised and still don’t know why. Maybe never will.&lt;/offtopic&gt;</p>
<p>This week Sam over at Financial Samurai published a post with the title <a href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-stop-worrying-about-childs-future/">How To Stop Worrying About Your Child’s Future In This Competitive World</a>. I will not discuss the post in depth, go and read, worth the time. Also, I want to note that, despite the debate escalated about if he over-worries his son’s future, I agree with him in every detail. Maybe I am overstressing this topic too, but to be honest my whole journey into personal finance was kickstarted by the birth of my first daughter.</p>
<p>When I first held my daughter in my arms I realized that life will never be the same again and that now I have someone whom I will worry until the day I die. Four years later I have another one girl to worry about. And my mindset about stability and security changed entirely. This is a Funny Friday post, so I will not go into the details (keep them for a future post). Instead here are a handful of memes about the things popped into my mind about this topic. Don’t try to search for a storyline or any structure, this is an “off the top of my head” type of list.</p>
<h2>Negotiating</h2>
<p>Kids are extremely good in negotiating. Especially if it is about going to bed or eating another slice of chocolate. We should embrace this skill in them instead of suppressing it. What if they would be aware of their financial situation?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-408" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_negotiating.jpg" alt="Funny-Fiday-7-Negotiation" width="750" height="500"></p>
<h2>Practice what you preach</h2>
<p>Like it or not, we are role models to them at least in the early years. Don’t let the lack of interest or attention they keep an eye on your every single move and record everything. Knowing this it is extremely important to practice what you preach.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-407" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_loan.jpg" alt="Practice what you preach - Loan" width="500" height="902"></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-403" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_godfather.jpg" alt="Practice what you preach - Godfather" width="500" height="599"></p>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<p>You will be responsible for teaching the basic concepts of life, relationships, and finances to them properly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-405" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_concepts.jpg" alt="Basic concepts - FIRE" width="468" height="615"></p>
<h2>Careers</h2>
<p>While you should not force them to choose a career path you prefer, you should totally give them advice and try to protect them from stepping on the wrong path.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-406" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_career.jpg" alt="Career choice" width="494" height="688"></p>
<h2>Family business</h2>
<p>Creating a family business, teaching them valuable lessons and then when the time comes passing down the keys to them is an absolutely good thing in my opinion. My father is working in the family business which was started by my grandfather (imagine nothing fancy, there are two workers, he and my grandma). After working for others for 20+ years and got laid down in a very inappropriate way, this was the thing which made him able to provide a living for his family.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-401" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_takeover.jpg" alt="Family Business Takeover" width="526" height="394"></p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Taking the compound interest into account even this blog could develop into a valuable asset which I could leave as an inheritance to my children (or grandchildren). How cool would it be to hand down the site to them?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-402" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_get_a_job.jpg" alt="Get a real job!" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-404" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_retired.jpg" alt="Bitch please, I am retired!" width="500" height="332"></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Happy Friday the 13th everyone</h2>
<p>When I was brainstorming for today&#8217;s post I really wanted to target this special day. Unfortunately, my research did not provide me enough financially related (and funny) information to be able to tailor a whole article around the topic. Anyway, I just leave here the only one I fabricated. I love you Jason, please don’t come after me!&nbsp;<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f603.png" alt="😃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-295" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_3_jason.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Jason" width="520" height="347"></p>

<p>This date is associated with bad luck, so I was thinking maybe I should make some bad luck memes, like the one about <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/funny-friday-cars-edition#othalafehu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Othalafehu</a> in the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/funny-friday-cars-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cars Edition</a> two weeks ago. While researching this topic I bumped into two articles (one from Sean at <a href="http://mymoneywizard.com/how-to-protect-yourself-from-id-theft-equifax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyMoneyWizard.com</a>&nbsp;and the other from Liz at <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/2017/09/21/worried-about-equifax-identity-theft-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChiefMomOfficer.org</a>) about the recent data breach at Equifax. I was aware of the event, however, I just checked it from a coder perspective. But as some fellow bloggers reported suspicious credit card activity in the recent weeks this pretty much qualifies as the most unlucky situation recently. So despite that, the phenomenon is not funny at all I thought that maybe a little bit of recap of the story could come handy.</p>
<h2>The warmup</h2>
<p>It all started with an innocent flirt in March. Her name was Alice and she was an innocent little server living in the Equifax server park.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_3_server.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Server" width="500" height="683"></p>
<p>While she was hanging on the internet at work a handsome hacker, let&#8217;s call him Kevin, popped up and started pinging her.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-299" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_3_hacker.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Hacker" width="449" height="449"></p>
<p>They were dating for the next couple of weeks.&nbsp;While enjoying their time together they shared a lot of personal information. In mid-May, they decided that they are a great match and the time has come to take their relationship to the next level. Unfortunately, it turned out that Kevin was not the nice guy he seemed to be.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_3_going_in_dry.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Going-In-Dry" width="750" height="500"></p>
<p>After that night she refused all requests for establishing any kind of connection with him.&nbsp;A couple of days later, on July 29th a terrible thing happened. Lucy found out that Kevin not just abused her but left a little gift behind.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-296" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_3_alice_breach.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Alice" width="405" height="430"></p>
<p>The next day she walked into her boss&#8217;s office and confessed everything. He was mad at her of course.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-294" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_3_obi_wan.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Obi-Wan" width="600" height="341"></p>
<p>They removed her from duty and was sent on a mandatory holiday into a&nbsp;recreation center.</p>
<p>Ok, I know that I just made up this part, but admit that &#8220;still a better love story than twilight&#8221;.&nbsp;We don’t know much about that part so I had to rely on my imagination. Now let&#8217;s get serious. Just kidding, this is Funny Friday. But let&#8217;s go on with some facts.</p>
<h2>Shit hit the fan</h2>
<p>Shortly after they discovered the breach management gathered to discuss how to handle this unlucky situation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-293" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_3_godfather.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Godfather" width="485" height="365"></p>
<p>And they came to the single best solution.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-292" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_3_villains.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Villains" width="500" height="361"></p>
<blockquote><p>On 7 September, 2017, Equifax announced a cybercrime identity theft event potentially impacting approximately 145.5 million U.S. consumers.&nbsp;Credit card numbers for approximately 209,000 U.S. consumers, and certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers were also accessed.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equifax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-291" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_3_too_damn_high.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Too-Damn-High" width="500" height="616"></p>
<h2>The &#8220;solution&#8221;</h2>
<p>They had to provide a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">solution</span> band-aid for the people. So they created a website where the users were able to check if they were affected.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-290" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_3_laughing_suit.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Laughing-Suit" width="500" height="333"></p>
<p>Media advised consumers to request a credit freeze to reduce the impact of the breach. Which accidentally could mean <a href="http://mymoneywizard.com/disgusting-negligence-earns-equifax-1-4-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another $4.3 billion</a> in revenue for the same company.&nbsp;Equifax announced on September 12 that they &#8220;are waiving all Security Freeze fees for the next 30 days&#8221;. Which is good if you are able to do it by then.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_3_finding_neverland.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Finding-Neverland" width="423" height="600"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, we did so good work here in the personal finance blogosphere that their Chief Information Officer and Chief Security Officer have decided on September 15th to jump into early retirement with both feet.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-288" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_3_leaving_work.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Leaving-Work" width="620" height="428"></p>
<h2>Whats next?</h2>
<p>Olsen Daines PC filed the case along with Geragos &amp; Geragos, a firm that specializes in class-action suits. They’ll be seeking up to $70 billion in damages, which would be the largest class-action suit in US history.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_3_ned_stark.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Ned-Stark" width="622" height="477"></p>
<p>We can just guess about who is in the background of the hack. There are some theories, but probably we will never know the real answer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-286" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funny_friday_3_aliens.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Aliens" width="500" height="437"></p>
<p>Thats all for today folks. Hope you enjoyed this little meme mashup about this unlucky event. If you liked it please share your thoughts in the comments and share this with whoever can benefit from the story. Also check out the posts from Sean at <a href="http://mymoneywizard.com/how-to-protect-yourself-from-id-theft-equifax/">MyMoneyWizard.com</a>&nbsp;and Liz at <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/2017/09/21/worried-about-equifax-identity-theft-resources/">ChiefMomOfficer.org</a>&nbsp;which provided me with info and this topic for today.</p>
<p>Have a Funny Friday the 13th.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I was struggling with the topic and the content for the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/funny-friday/">Funny Friday</a>. Was kind of busy week both at home and at work and to bring more complexity to the equation 3/4 of the family caught a cold. I was afraid that I will fail in consistency so soon.</p>
<p>Then today <a href="http://www.mysonsfather.com/">MySonsFather</a> posted his epic series starter post <a href="http://www.mysonsfather.com/financial-mount-rushmore/">&#8220;My Financial Mount Rushmore&#8221;</a> and saved the day. In metaphor with the sculptures of the four presidents, he collected his five financial influencers and made awesome Lego images from them, bringing the level of his craft to Arch-Mage heights.</p>
<p>I had these plans for the future to turn some financial idols into memes and suddenly I felt that this could be the perfect time to start it. I am not really good with that copyrighting stuff so tried to find some good images on google which are free to use. Hope that all of them are, but if you discover yourself on one of them and you don&#8217;t like it contact me to remove (nobody likes a lawsuit).</p>
<p>I have never seen Mount Rushmore, but it is definitely on the bucket list. To consolidate the tradition I will go for my five most influential financial icons too. Similar to MSF I will start with an author too followed by my favorite bloggers. Have fun.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.richdad.com/">Robert Kiyosaki</a></h2>
<p>I know, I know, there is a big hype factor in his reputation, still getting the &#8220;Rich dad, poor dad&#8221; into your hands is kind of a gateway drug to more hardcore financial stuff. My pathfinding started with this book and it undeniably contains a huge amount of wisdom which was essential to kickstart my mindset shift. Like him or not this is a must read in my opinion. Period.</p>
<p>I got the recommendation from my cousin, then borrowed the book from a friend. It was good to follow the story of an average guy who was lucky enough the have two role models in his life and distill the conclusions from both of their lives. Knowing that the little kid who was melting toothpaste tubes to make coins was able to become an influential businessman and friend of the president of the states fills my heart with hope.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">Pete Adeney aka Mr. Money Mustache</a></h2>
<p>To be honest I have no idea how I ended up at mrmoneymustache.com but as I read the first article I was doomed. In the following weeks, I was voraciously digging through his articles from the first to the latest one, fanatically reading every word of them. Insert confession bear here: I rarely read the comments and never left one <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Cannot really emphasize the impact this man made on my life. Probably receiving his wisdom just at the right time kept me from stepping on the dark route of hedonic adaptation. His example strengthened my personality and forced me to keep up with my already existing frugality. Dare I say that he engraved a little bit of badassity into me too? Maybe. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/">Ramit Sethi</a></h2>
<p>Maybe you are surprised that these two names appear one after another. Seemingly they don&#8217;t really like each other. Or at least each others mindset. But I was always a fan of the &#8220;listen to everyone and then distill the essence&#8221; principle. I got to Ramit via MMM after all.</p>
<p>Undeniably this guy is a superstar in psychology, marketing, an incredible showman and a very talented businessman. He is honest, sometimes brutally honest, which is a quality I highly appreciate in anyone. Like him or not his results are astonishing, his lifestyle advice is valuable and the number of people he helped with his work is respectable.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.1500days.com/">Carl aka Mr. 1500 Days</a></h2>
<p>I discovered Carl&#8217;s blog just before he retired so I was not an early bird here. This was the second blog which I read from &#8220;cover to cover&#8221; and following ever since. Besides the funny writing style, his personality is what caught me in his posts. Unlike the gurus mentioned above, he is more a role model to me, probably because I can relate to him more.</p>
<p>He has a wonderful wife (several times when I really liked a post at his blog I had to realize it was written by her). So do I. He has two awesome daughters. So do I. He is a coder. Just like me (ok he is probably much more smarter than me). He is financially independent and retired early. So do&#8230; naah, we can stop here, just daydreaming. But I have ~3500 days to catch up, so there is hope <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/">J$</a></h2>
<p>Existence in the personal finance blogosphere is unimaginable without knowing who J. Money is or being aware of all the cool stuff rockstarfinance.com provides to the community. Lately, I have problems reading all the cool stuff out there thus I reside on their curated trinity of posts every day in terms of discovering new names in the game.</p>
<p>Most important lessons I learned from him:</p>
<ul>
<li>Budgets Are Sexy, You Need A Budget</li>
<li>people can take you seriously even on the financial field while you have a mohawk</li>
<li>while building up a stash it does not hurt if you are collecting money, literally</li>
<li>you never ever sell your “pets”, not even for a million (kudos)</li>
<li>a layoff can turn into a wonderful beginning</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>This was a good exercise and I wouldn&#8217;t really be able to put more people on this list. Mainly because a lot of my other favorite bloggers write anonymously and you cannot find a picture of them. But mark my words, your time will come too <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed this &#8220;Rushmore Edition&#8221;, have a Funny Friday.</p>
