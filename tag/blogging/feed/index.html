										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To be totally honest I wasn&#8217;t sure if this day will come. But it did, so I can peacefully write it down:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am six months into blogging.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe it seems like not a big deal to you, but it is huge for me. I am a recovering procrastinator and a serial quitter. Back in last September when I published <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/escaping-the-matrix/">my first post</a>&nbsp;with trembling hands I was a total noob. Wrote a mini CMS before, just for fun (and for some side money) but never spent more than 5 minutes in WordPress. Never used social media accounts. And last but not least I have never published anything online, especially not in English.</p>
<p>Now, six months later, I am confident with using WordPress, configuring plugins, messing around with domain names, hosting settings and even with <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/memes-reloaded/">the source code</a>. As an IT guy, this shouldn&#8217;t be a big surprise, actually, it would be a shame if I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>What is even a bigger achievement for me, is that I get along with Twitter, my first and only social media account. Maybe I dare say I like it. The rest of the social media platforms are still &#8220;terra incognita&#8221; for me and I am ok with this situation for now.</p>
<p>Still, the biggest win for me is that I managed to write some articles which entertained, educated or forced people to think about the topic. And most importantly in a way that they understood what I wanted to say. For a not native speaker, like me, this was a big challenge and a great exercise. (Fun fact: wrote roughly 30k words)</p>
<p>When I see this kind of reports from other bloggers they always publish some numbers. I did too when I was three months into this gig and <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/">struggled with doubts</a>. So let&#8217;s see the progress. Also, summarize the wins and fails.</p>
<h2>Numbers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Published posts: 37 (14 of them in the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/funny-friday/">Funny Friday series</a>, 5 of them in the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/memes/">Memes</a>&nbsp;section)</li>
<li>All time views: 3785 (by 2416 visitors)</li>
<li>Email subscribers: 3 (+1 in the last three months, woot-woot)</li>
<li>Followers: 7(+2) via WordPress, 286(+94) via Twitter</li>
<li>Most popular post:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/pirates-of-the-cryptobbean/">Pirates of the Cryptobbean</a></li>
<li>Best views ever: March 6th, 877 views from 720 visitors on a single day</li>
<li>Best referrers: <a href="http://rockstarfinance.com/">RockstarFinance</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://thefinancialdiet.com/">TheFinancialDiet</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep blogging for at least a year &#8211; six months check, so good so far</li>
<li>Established and consolidated connections and friendships in the community</li>
<li>Started an interview series (<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/coders-of-finance/">Coders of Finance</a>)</li>
<li>My first crypto post, <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/pirates-of-the-cryptobbean/">Pirates of the Cryptobbean</a>&nbsp;got selected and featured on <a href="https://rockstarfinance.com/pirates-of-the-cryptobbean/">RockStarFinance</a>&nbsp;(a big THANKS to <a href="http://lifezemplified.com/">Amy</a> and <a href="https://esimoney.com">ESI</a>) &#8211; This was the biggest win of this six months, one which I didn&#8217;t dare dream about!</li>
<li>When I mentioned one of my articles(my personal favorite, <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/memento-mori/">Memento Mori</a>) in a comment to <a href="http://jmoney.biz/">J$</a>(one of my blogger role models) over at <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/why-im-obsessed-with-cemeteries/">BudgetsAreSexy</a>&nbsp;he was able to recall it and quote the last sentences. It was a proud moment <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-707" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/crypto_skull.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401"></p>
<h2>Fails</h2>
<p>The only thing I regret is that I did not create enough new content. I had some personal barriers, but still, this is not a good excuse. The struggle of finding the time to write is still there, but I have to be honest with myself, I was not able to sacrifice family time for blogging. Not sure where that leaves me, but while blogging is a helluva fun cannot beat playing with my kids, reading bedtime stories and watching them fall asleep. I would sacrifice becoming the most successful blogger at any given time for being just a moderately awesome dad.</p>
<h2>Plans</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creating more useful content and publishing more articles is a huge goal for me, but I can promise that I will not hit the publish button just to publish something. Not a single time. That is over.</li>
<li>Continue searching for my voice/tribe/niche and as part of this, I want the blog to get more techie. I have plans on writing a few blogging tutorials about my experiences and going on with the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/coders-of-finance/">Coders of Finance</a> interview series and publish one every second week.</li>
<li>Start making memes again, there was a hiatus lately.</li>
<li>Keep it simple, keep it real <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s it for today, let&#8217;s review the things above in three months.</p>
<p>Thank you all for the encouragement and the kind words! You are awesome!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all, I want to wish a success packed very Happy New Year. I wasn&#8217;t too active in the recent holiday season and spent the last month getting back on track. As I stated in earlier I want to turn 2018 into a more techie year, thus I spent the last couple of days with geeking around with WordPress. The goal was to give memes a new way of appearance as I sent the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/funny-friday/">Funny Friday</a> series into early retirement.</p>
<p>I have to confess something. Before I started my blog and started using WordPress I was a hater. Back in the days when I entered web development, I was taught that it is evil. It is just a big pile of crappy spaghetti code and if you use it bad boys will hack your site and steal your data (maybe even your soul). I was a newbie and they were the seniors, so I accepted what they said and went on hating WordPress without any further investigation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-671" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/i_hated_wordpress.jpg" alt="I hated WordPress" width="460" height="480"></p>
<p>It is true that in those times these statements were partly valid. Those early versions were not so sophisticated and there were much more poorly coded third-party plugins and themes. These caused serious security problems in some cases. Still, I regret that I did not start&nbsp;examining the codebase and experimenting with template and plugin development earlier. I could be a WP Wizard these days.</p>
<p>Years went by. When I started to learn about blogging and realized that almost 30% (crazy!) percent of the&nbsp;websites on the internet is running on this platform this regret became even worse. Since I started this blog, I really wanted to dig a little bit into the topic and get my hands dirty. Unfortunately, while I was chasing my own deadlines I was not able to do so. Finally, the rethinking of the Funny Friday meme series brought the need for opening the hood and add tiny bits of code. As it turned out WP has a very handy develop documentation.</p>
<p>If you are not interested in a little bit of coding and you are satisfied with the functionality the codebase and the UI can provide, please, don&#8217;t read further. Just be delighted that the brand new MEMES sections became accessible from the top menu. Every time the muse visits me and I make a meme I will post it there. There will be new ones every sometimes <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h1>The tweak</h1>
<p>You may ask why did I have to tweak my WP setup to make this possible. Well, maybe it is just my personal preference, but I wanted the memes listing page to work a little bit differently. First of all, created a separate category called &#8220;Memes&#8221;, created a separate menu item for its listing page and added the first post,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/dont-save-like-dory/">Dory</a>&nbsp;as my guinea pig (ok, maybe this is confusing). The post format was set to &#8220;Image&#8221;, well&#8230; because memes will be single/multi-image posts. The first thing I faced that this case Dory will jump to my main landing page as it will become the latest post.</p>
<h2>Homepage exclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Maybe not a big deal, but as these posts will not have a featured image and it seems the excerpt, which shows up by default will not display the one and only image, the whole item looks odd. so I decided that the posts from this category should be excluded from the main listing page. A short search told me this is not something WP supports by default. There is a plugin for that (as for many other things), but I felt it an overkill for such a simple task. Same time, the fewer plugins you use the lower the overall complexity will be and because of this, I try to use as few plugins as possible. Further investigations lead me to the solution to supplement the theme&#8217;s functions. You can enter into theme file editor through Appearance menu&#8217;s Editor option. Then on the right side, you can find (probably, not true for all versions and all themes) Theme Functions (functions.php). You can exclude one or more categories from the main listing page adding the following lines to the end of the file.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<pre>function exclude_category( $query ) {
    if ( $query-&gt;is_home() &amp;&amp; $query-&gt;is_main_query() ) {
        $query-&gt;set( 'cat', '-33' );
    }
}
add_action( 'pre_get_posts', 'exclude_category' );</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You may ask &#8220;what the heck is happening here?&#8221;. Well, we declare a function called <strong><em>exclude_category</em></strong> which performs a check if the current query is the query for the blog homepage and if it is the main query. If both statements evaluate to true, then we exclude the memes category from the query. The only information you need is the category ID which you can find out from the URL when you are editing it (&#8230;&amp;tag_ID=33&#8230; in my case). The minus sign before the category ID indicates that this is an exclusion. When WordPress is rendering our page after creating the query object, but before running it calls the hook called&nbsp;<strong><em>pre_get_posts&nbsp;</em></strong>which calls our function. The exclusion takes effect and from now on the posts from the <em>memes&nbsp;</em>category will not show up on the homepage.</p>
<h2>Custom memes category page</h2>
<p>Now when I checked the <em>Memes</em>&nbsp;listing page and what I saw is that the posts are still not showing up properly. It turned out that the theme uses the same setting for the category pages as the homepage to determine if it should show the whole posts or just the excerpts in the list. Because of the aforementioned reasons, we have to do something with this too. A little bit of research revealed that on rendering a category page, it looks for templates in the following order: <em>category-slug.php → category-id.php → category.php → archive.php → index.php</em>. In my theme, the <em>archive.php</em> template is the one which was responsible for rendering the Memes category page, so the only thing I had to do is to make a copy of it, rename it to <em>category-memes.php</em>&nbsp;and make some changes.</p>
<p>The original archives.php look like:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php
/**
 * The template for displaying archive pages.
 *
 *
 *
 * @package Nisarg
 */
get_header(); ?&gt;
	&lt;div class="container"&gt;
		&lt;div class="row"&gt;
			&lt;?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?&gt;
				&lt;header class="archive-page-header"&gt;
					&lt;?php
						the_archive_title( '&lt;h3 class="archive-page-title"&gt;'.__( 'Browsed by', 'nisarg' ).'&lt;br&gt;', '&lt;/h3&gt;' );
						the_archive_description( '&lt;div class="taxonomy-description"&gt;', '&lt;/div&gt;' )
					?&gt;
				&lt;/header&gt;&lt;!-- .page-header --&gt;
				&lt;div id="primary" class="col-md-9 content-area"&gt;
					&lt;main id="main" class="site-main" role="main"&gt;
					&lt;?php /* Start the Loop */
					while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
						/*
						 * If you want to disaplay only excerpt, file content-excerpt.php will be used.
						 * Include the Post-Format-specific template for the content.
						 * If you want to override this in a child theme, then include a file
						 * called content-___.php (where ___ is the Post Format name) and that will be used instead.
						 */
						$post_display_option = get_theme_mod( 'post_display_option', 'post-excerpt' );

						if ( 'post-excerpt' === $post_display_option ) {
							get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', 'excerpt' );
						} else {
							get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', get_post_format() );
						}
					endwhile;
					nisarg_posts_navigation(); ?&gt;
			&lt;?php else : ?&gt;
				&lt;?php get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', 'none' ); ?&gt;
			&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
				&lt;/main&gt;&lt;!-- #main --&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #primary --&gt;
			&lt;?php get_sidebar( 'sidebar-1' ); ?&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--.row--&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--.container--&gt;
&lt;?php get_footer(); ?&gt;</pre>
<p>After some decluttering the result is:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php
/**
 * The template for displaying memes category pages.
 *
 *
 *
 * @package Nisarg
 */
get_header(); ?&gt;
	&lt;div class="container"&gt;
		&lt;div class="row"&gt;
			&lt;?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?&gt;
				&lt;div id="primary" class="col-md-9 content-area"&gt;
					&lt;main id="main" class="site-main" role="main"&gt;
					&lt;?php /* Start the Loop */
					while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
						get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', get_post_format() );
					endwhile;
					nisarg_posts_navigation(); ?&gt;
			&lt;?php else : ?&gt;
				&lt;?php get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', 'none' ); ?&gt;
			&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
				&lt;/main&gt;&lt;!-- #main --&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #primary --&gt;
			&lt;?php get_sidebar( 'sidebar-1' ); ?&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--.row--&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--.container--&gt;
&lt;?php get_footer(); ?&gt;</pre>
<p>As you may see I have removed the unnecessary &#8220;Browsed by&#8221; part and removed the excerpt possibility.</p>
<p>So good so far. There is a separate menu point for the &#8220;Memes&#8221;, the posts do not show up on the homepage and their category page displays them properly.</p>
<p>There is only one thing remaining. <a href="https://jetpack.com/">Jetpack</a> does good work in the comments section, auto-sharing on twitter and sending notification emails on new posts. However, when published Dory I realized that maybe my readers would not want to be notified by each and every new meme.</p>
<h2>Exclusion from the notifications</h2>
<p>Searching for such an option proved ineffectual so I turned again to good ol&#8217; Google. Shortly after I added this couple of lines of code to the end of my <em>functions.php.</em></p>
<pre>add_filter( 'jetpack_subscriptions_exclude_these_categories', 'exclude_these' );
function exclude_these( $categories ) {
	$categories = array( 'memes' );
	return $categories;
}</pre>
<p>I won&#8217;t waste many words on this, the code is self-explanatory and does the trick.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all. Not a big deal from a technical perspective but it was fun. Depending on your technical savviness the things in this post can range from &#8220;black magic&#8221; to &#8220;piece of cake&#8221;. Whichever is the case thanks for reading and please share your thoughts with me in the comments about WordPress. Oh, and please let me know if I should go on this geeky road further or get back to the stories of the good ol&#8217; days (I have both on my list).</p>

<p>Thank you and enjoy the brand new <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/memes/">MEMES</a> section.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I was talking(whining) about my <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/">blogging struggles</a>, so there come the solutions. Also, thank you for the encouragement I received, good to know that I am not alone with schedule problems. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>Posting schedule</h2>
<p>My posting frequency so far was two posts per week, one content-based and one meme based. I like to work on both, but the way I was doing it is very inefficient. Living from post to post and write and publish in last minute is not the desired path. I am far from being satisfied with the quality of some of my posts and the best description I can give to them is funny/entertaining (well, most of the times :)). I want to shoot for writing quality content (Rockstar Quality maybe?), using more time, more research and going more in depth.</p>
<p>We are always told that post often and post consistently. That is how great success will come. While this is definitely true it seems that this is not the only way. As it turned out the urge to meet this recommendation did nothing good for my content and pushed me into the struggle. Then I remembered the <a href="https://doyouevenblog.com/podcast/1/">first podcast episode</a> I heard from <a href="https://twitter.com/doyouevenblog">Pete McPherson</a> over at <a href="https://doyouevenblog.com/">DoYouEvenBlog.com</a> which he recorded with our fellow financial blogger <a href="https://www.physicianonfire.com/">PhysicianOnFire</a>. At some point, he was talking about that it is a shame that a lot of newbies quit very soon and asked the question why don&#8217;t they reduce posting frequency instead to experiment what works for them and what does not. Pete gives some more tips <a href="https://doyouevenblog.com/blog-post-schedule/">here</a>, definitely worth reading.</p>
<p>This is exactly what I will do. Starting with January I will post only one or two posts per month. I hope that this will help to allocate more time for working on my articles which will be able to provide more value to my readers. Same time it will force me to focus more on the topics. In the past I was picking them randomly, however, I had a long list of potential titles before started blogging. I will combine them with my newer list and choose the most interesting dozen of them. Also, I can not promise that there will not be any random post, like the last (and only, so far) <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/tuesday-rant-six-figure-problem/">rant</a>(?).</p>
<h2><img class="wp-image-609 aligncenter" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/notebook-428293_640-300x198.jpg" alt="Notebook" width="400" height="264"></h2>
<h2>Filling blank spaces</h2>
<p>Following the path I described above I still afraid that the lack of weekly fresh stuff will make my tiny reader base abandon the site, so I knew that I have to find out something. Taking into account this fact and combining it with my personal interests I came to the solution that I will fill the void with series and guest posts.</p>
<h3>Series</h3>
<p>For a while, I was thinking about this and came up with two ideas. The first one is purely fueled by personal interests and I have already reached out to two fellow bloggers who accepted my participation request and have some more on my list to reach out. This will be called <strong>&#8220;Coders of FInance&#8221;</strong> and as you probably guessed, I will interview programmers and IT professionals about their lives, jobs, and their FI journey.</p>
<p>The second topic is much more tricky, I feel that it will be a challenge to find participants. The series can be called <strong>&#8220;World on FIRE&#8221;</strong>, but this is not carved in stone. We get a huge amount of information about FIRE strategies and most of them are very US specific. The fact that I am a non-US dweller myself and that I bet a lot of other members of our community has a healthy amount of financial voyeurism gave me the idea of starting a post series about FIRE strategies, vehicles, possibilities in other countries.</p>
<h3>Guest posts</h3>
<p>This is probably not a big surprise, everybody does it. I have already collected 5-6 titles which I find very promising, will see if someone would be interested in writing about them. Don&#8217;t want to share them at this point, but trust me these will be special <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Hey, you forgot about Funny Friday</h3>
<p>I have a confession. I am a meme addict. Same time I am not that dumb to stop making these which brought probably some of you alone to my site. But that series in its current state is not the best possible way, so be prepared, this week I will do a &#8220;Best Of&#8221; compilation and then I will shut it down. But don&#8217;t be afraid, my financial memes will come back next year in a new form, I have something in mind, just have to find out in the holidays how should I achieve that.</p>

<h2>Goals for 2018</h2>
<p>So just to summarize and finish off this year here are my blogging goals for the next year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay in blogging and make posting work</li>
<li>Start the aforementioned series</li>
<li>Bring fun into the FIRE community through memes</li>
<li>Receive my first guest post invitation (without asking)</li>
<li>See one of my articles end up featured on Rockstar Finance</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ok, that&#8217;s all folks. I will spend the holidays focusing on quality family time and working under the hood in my very limited free time so stay tuned for the Funny Friday &#8211; Best Of Edition this Friday as that will be my last post this year.</em></p>

For a while I did not know what should be the title of this post, then while working on it suddenly it started to play on <a href="http://www.deezer.com/">Deezer</a> and I knew that is it.

<p>As we are getting closer to the end of the year it seems that there are two recurring topics which bloggers write about these days. They are the reflection on the past year and goals for the next one. I am not an exception, these questions dug themselves heavily into my brain. Even some may have noticed that Tuesday I broke my posting schedule for the first time. This has two reasons. For one I was curious how would it affect my OCD <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The other is that I was not sure if I really want to publish this post, but finally decided to do so.</p>
<p>Today I am three months into blogging. It could be “not a big deal” for some of you, but for someone who has a long history of procrastination and giving things up for me, it is a big thing. When I started this hobby I was really curious how long can I get with it. My promise was that I should stick to it for at least a year, but then this reflection season hit me and forced me into the evaluation of the past three months. This process led to the aforementioned question. So, let me share my findings.</p>
<h2>The numbers</h2>
<p>Some bloggers share these type of reports monthly or quarterly. I did not do it so far because I felt that my numbers are nothing like someone should brag about, but to show the complete picture I decided to share them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Published posts: 26 (12 of them in the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/funny-friday/">Funny Friday series</a>)</li>
<li>All time views: 1477 (by 736 visitors)</li>
<li>Email subscribers: 2 (however I was thinking about reaching out if they are real persons, whatever, THANK YOU!)</li>
<li>Followers: 5 via WordPress, 192 via Twitter (THANK YOU ALL!)</li>
<li>Most popular post:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/tuesday-rant-six-figure-problem/">A Tuesday Rant – The Six Figure Problem</a></li>
<li>Best views ever: October 10, when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/the-best-budget-i-never-had/">The Best Budget I Never Had</a> was published</li>
<li>(Update: <a href="https://esimoney.com/">ESI Money</a> sabotaged the last stat by sharing <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/my-stuff-evaluation-ruleset/">My Stuff Evaluation Ruleset</a> on twitter and pushed it to December 13. Thanks, ESI <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</li>
<li>Best referrers: <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://rockstarfinance.com/">RockstarFinance</a> (directory &amp; forums)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see the results are not stellar, but at least they pretty much align with my marketing efforts. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>The achievements</h2>
<p>While I did not have predefined goals about the points in the&nbsp;previous section, I had some less quantitative ones.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep blogging for at least a year &#8211; three months check, so good so far</li>
<li>Learn the technical background of blogging &#8211; basic level reached</li>
<li>Become part of the community &#8211; there is space for improvement&nbsp;in terms of activity, but good enough I think</li>
<li>Make connections &#8211; I got in touch with many wonderful people and even some of my hero bloggers know about my existence, I can say that I am satisfied</li>
<li>Appear on <a href="http://rockstarfinance.com/gossip/">RockstarFinance</a> &#8211; achieved this, however only made it to the gossip section: HaltCatchFire turns $$$ bloggers into <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/funny-friday-rushmore-edition/">Memes</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>The struggles</h2>
<p>And we finally got to the part which made the title question a consideration at all. As seen in many posts I can only echo the saying &#8220;it&#8217;s all about time&#8221;. I can not say that I was not warned, so please when someone tells you that blogging requires a lot of time believe them. I was told that you should not start a blog if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are bad at time management/lack of free time &#8211; check</li>
<li>you have small children in da house &#8211; double check</li>
<li>won’t do it for free &#8211; I am ok with this</li>
</ul>
<p>My biggest concern is not numbers, achievements, etc, but the feeling that what I produced so far is not the best quality stuff I could provide. When I reread my articles I find them entertaining at most. Have to admit that most of the time I am living from post to post. Was not a single case when I have put together an article in the two hours before publishing. I had two prewritten articles in my buffer when I started and I used both of them so far. So, I have a writing problem&#8230;</p>
<p>Same time I am a geeky guy and have to admit that setting up the blog, playing with plugins and testing the performance was one of the funniest things in the whole process. I am more or less satisfied with the current setup, but it has endless possibilities for improvement (and having fun).</p>
<p>The third point here is socializing. I still don’t want to enter into the Facebook world and have no idea what Pinterest and Instagram good for, but I really fell in love with Twitter and would be good to be more active there. The other area is forums where I see a great opportunity for having meaningful conversations with like-minded people.</p>
<h2>The decision</h2>
<p>I would be a liar if I’d say that quit blogging has not crossed my mind. To be honest, sometimes it seemed the only logical decision. But it does not matter how much I was thinking about it, I just can’t. I have started and quit many things over the years and most of them I did not mind at all. But I have a feeling, a voice inside my head which constantly tells me “do not quit”. Thus, I came to the only viable conclusion. If I want to stay in blogging I have to redesign my process, my habits and the way I handle the things. So, if you were worried until this point, calm down, you won’t losing me. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>In terms of changes stay tuned, I will tell everything next week in my last post of the year. You will be surprised <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
