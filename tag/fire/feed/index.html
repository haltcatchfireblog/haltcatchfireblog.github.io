										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>Today I am shooting just a short notification towards you that this week I was the lucky guy who got featured on <a href="https://firehub.eu/bloggers-on-fire-haltcatchfire/">FIREHub.eu in the latest episode of their Bloggers on FIRE</a> series. You should definitely check out as the questions forced me to think about some aspects of the FI journey which I don&#8217;t do often. And of course, I highly recommend checking out the older episodes also <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Have a nice weekend and stay tuned as I will come back next week with more interesting content <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven years have passed since Pete Adeney alias <a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/04/06/meet-mr-money-mustache/">Mr. Money Mustache</a> started his blog and Mustachianism was born. He was not the one who started the FIRE movement itself but definitely brought the idea to more people than anyone before. The <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/the-history-of-fier/">roots of the concept of FIRE</a> are older than many of us imagine. It is not a new invention, but only the recent years brought higher popularity and broader media coverage. Like all other great movements, it also had its enemies. Naysayers,&nbsp;complainypantses, and trolls were everywhere. They are still out there but there are followers at equally huge numbers. And as the world changes our numbers are increasing.</p>
<p>The circumstances, the world order we are living in made necessary for most of us to start searching for answers. Basically, it pushes us into a financial awakening. At least the ones who are NOT willing to become/remain slaves of the system (at least not for many long decades). The ones who have open minds and constantly searching for the opportunity to become a better version of themselves and optimize their (and their loved ones) situation as much as they can. These everyday heroes are walking amongst us and I honestly think that they will make this world a better place.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s play with FIRE</h2>
<p>As someone who is a big fan of low information diet, I wasn&#8217;t aware of how mainstream media presents this phenomenon to the masses. Then the other day I read <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/2018/10/01/damaging-the-movement-i-love-the-problem-with-fire-stereotypes-and-the-mainstream-media/">this article from Liz</a> over at ChiefMomOfficer.com. It seems media still want to alienate people from the idea that they have a choice. That they have many options and many paths which they could follow. Then I get to know from the <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/travis-shakespeare-interview/">Mad Fientist that a documentary</a> is on its way to introduce the concept of FIRE to the people. Can&#8217;t wait watching it and to see the effect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Playing with FIRE: The Documentary (Official Trailer)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kD8uNm5ck0Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t let FIRE rest in peace</h2>
<p>Same time it seems that even oceans of water cannot stop the spreading of FIRE. On the other side of the pond, here in our beloved Europe, the warriors of FIRE started to gather under the flag of <a href="https://retireinprogress.com/european-early-retirement-guide-a-call-to-action/">Mr.RIP to bring the European Codex of FIRE</a> into existence. We are joining our forces to gather all the information from all corners of the continent which could help anyone to improve his/her financial situation and kick off the journey towards a happier life packed with freedom and joy. It will require a huge amount of work but we will do our best to make it happen. As they say,&nbsp;‚Äúnothing worth having comes easy‚Äù.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1105 aligncenter" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/book-1740515_640.png" alt="Book" width="300" height="200"></p>
<h2>Nadir</h2>
<p>And finally, after becoming so energized and optimistic by these news, the internet (ok, maybe not the whole internet but our corner definitely) was blown up by <a href="http://podcast.affordanything.com/153-hate-fire-movement-suze-orman/">Paula Pants latest podcast episode</a> in which she interviewed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suze_Orman">Suze Orman</a> about her thoughts on the FIRE movement. It turned out that she <strong>hates it</strong>. She hates it, hates it, hates it. If somehow you did not hear it and you don&#8217;t believe me check out the episode yourself.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I got pissed off. I am not that kind of people who spend their time engaging in catfights in the virtual space but this time I felt the urge to jump into the pit. I even shared the <a href="https://twitter.com/_HaltCatchFire/status/1047387150814203904">link on Twitter</a> and added a very &#8220;clever&#8221; and &#8220;funny&#8221; comment, saying <em>&#8220;Suze is totally right. If you are a person who understands the FIRE concepts as good as she does it would be the worst idea to pursuing FIRE&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1111" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2jbmxo.jpg" alt="castaway" width="444" height="311"></p>
<p>Shame on me, the truth is that before I was listening to this episode I had no clue about who is Suze Orman. I heard her name a few times but was not even aware that she has anything to do with finance. I thought she is just another celebrity whose opinion is important to the brainwashed masses. Then I realized that if I would follow this path I could end up hate talking about a person whom I know nothing about.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Exactly as she did with the FIRE movement.</em></p>
<h2>FIRE in my eyes</h2>
<p>For anyone who is familiar with the concept, it was shining through the interview that she knows the world and its financial problems very well but she doesn&#8217;t get the concept in its wholeness. Thus I keeping myself to my tweet. Any Average Joe who only understands that reaching FIRE is a three-step process (work hard, save and invest, create a portfolio of one million dollars or 25x annual expenses and you are done) should not jump into FIRE with both feet because he will &#8220;burn alive&#8221; (at least he died trying).</p>
<p>FIRE is not a one-size-fits-all recipe and comes in many flavors. It is as unique as we are. There is a big chance that my path and my journey will be very different from anyone else&#8217;s. Even for a single person, there are many paths which could potentially lead to their goal. Following the FIRE movement does not mean that you are joining a flock marching towards the same destination. It is about mastering the tools and concepts which helps you analyze the world you are living, examining your current situation, designing a better version of your reality, and putting together a plan to get there.</p>
<h2>So who is Suze Orman after all?</h2>
<p>As I am part of the FIRE scene only for a couple of years so far (mostly those years when she was in &#8220;early&#8221; retirement) and didn&#8217;t know much about her I did what anyone does when trying to find out something. Entered her name into Google and went to Wikipedia for the info. I will not echo here her life story but have to admit that what she achieved is pretty impressing. Writing and publishing ten books is a huge achievement alone. Successfully selling an idea for thousands of people is also a great achievement.</p>
<p><strong>So what could we learn from Suze? Honestly, a lot.</strong> As someone who is walking on this earth for a long time and spent a significant part of that in the financial industry probably knows more about finances than many of us. Even the list of the potential risks she brought up in the interview is very legit. The problem was (as Paula summarized pretty good at the end of the episode) that she missed the point that the concept of FIRE contains the principle that you should include the handling of these risks in your master plan. You should be prepared for them. Even for the almost post-apocalyptic, AI-driven&nbsp;dark future, she painted so colorfully. If you don&#8217;t know where to <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/prepping-for-non-preppers-101/">start prepping</a> let me help you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1122" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/noah.jpg" alt="Noah" width="500" height="476"></p>
<h2>So why is she wrong?</h2>
<p>I checked many comments in various comment sections and amongst the many many valid ones found the most appealing to me. There was one saying that she totally lost her connection with reality. Well, it is true and false at the same time. She lost her connection to OUR reality as hers is totally different. As I mentioned above, FIRE comes in many different flavors. Let&#8217;s pull out your spreadsheets about your NUMBER. Then find out how much does it cost to own a villa on a private island and change your housing costs to that. Replace your commute expenses with the cost of operating a private jet. Estimate a grocery budget of hers. If you do this all there is a chance that her NUMBER is much higher than the average folk&#8217;s and the 25x result probably will end up in those decamillions. But in the land of frugality, it just does not work like that.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1124" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2jevra.jpg" alt="Back in my day" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>She designed a very luxurious lifestyle for herself and probably for her well of clients also. But this does not represent the average FIRE seeker. We are a very inhomogenous bunch of people. Some of us earn seven-figure incomes but some of us only lower five-digits. There are single folks, families, old and young people and all kind of humans from all possible genders, races,&nbsp;and religions. But these variables are all irrelevant. What determines your ability of reaching FIRE is your willingness to improve yourself and your desperation to follow the path which leads there. If you are continuously thinking about if you could reach FIRE you are pondering on the wrong question. The good ones are HOW and WHEN&#8230;</p>
<p>I also checked some blog posts about the topic. I tend to believe that <a href="https://www.getrichslowly.org/suze-orman-fire/">J.D. Roth is right</a> about her feelings. He wrote that&nbsp;<em>&#8220;I think she feels threatened&#8221;</em>. The FIRE movement is an organic, self-organizing thing. It has its heroes (and villains) but it does not need Suze Ormans to give you a one-size-fits-all type recipe to be financially successful. Especially if that includes spinning the hamster wheel into our seventies. The global mindset about how should we spend our working time is shifting. Deal with it. Also, as <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/suze-orman-new-avocado-toast-dont-buy/">Early Retirement Dude pointed out wonderfully</a>, throwing such a speech without backing it by rock-solid evidence besides her own thoughts is true irresponsibility. Like bringing a knife into a gunfight. Did you think that our legions of financial nerds will not go after you, call you out and tear your statements into pieces?</p>
<h2>Closing words</h2>
<p>Some folks hate Suze Orman, some folks love her. Some got disappointed right now and some still agree with her. But who am I to judge people for this? Everybody has the right to have an opinion. So do I. So does Suze&#8230; Let me add one of her quotes here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t let what others think or say get in your way; their actions reflect on them, not you.&#8221; &#8211; Suze Orman &#8211;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see? She is not wrong in everything and can give you valuable advice indeed. So stick to that and don&#8217;t let what she thinks or says get into the way of your FIRE plans. Her actions reflect on herself not you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Lastly, this is the final time for the mainstream media to kill not only the <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2018/10/05/the-fire-movement/">stereotype of the white male engineer</a> as the only potential FIRE prospect but also the image of the lazy quitter millennial who is desperately searching for an escape from the hamster wheel while dreaming about sitting on a pile of money (by luck or windfall) at a sunny beach sipping margaritas and scratching his balls all day. Please start painting a more accurate picture about FIRE folks. There are hundreds of mind-blowing examples out there. You only have to reach out to them&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in the time <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/the-only-thing-i-dont-get-about-reaching-fire/">I already wrote about</a> my thoughts on the fear of getting bored in retirement. I did not change my views but as keep seeing posts popping up about the topic I had a think what I would do after reaching FIRE. Of course besides the travel the world and spend most of my time with family general ideas. So here is it, check out my non-complete list of ideas for having fun in retirement.</p>
<h2>Art</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1049" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cupboard-349935_640-300x200.jpg" alt="cupboard" width="300" height="200">Anyone who knows me could tell that I am not much of an artist. Last time I tried to draw a horse my daughter was impressed by the result. She told me it is a cute dog&#8230; However, there is a field I see some opportunities. When I was a kid I wanted to become a carpenter. Later fell in love and this dream never came true but once I enter the FIRE club you could bet that I would happily dive into woodworking and craftsmanship. Probably would not build houses like MMM but definitely would put my skills into work on some smaller projects. So far I was fascinated by videos where someone turns old/used furniture and renovates it or turns into come completely different thing. Also, have a feeling for pyrography. What if I could combine this two, get some old wood material polish it and burn some text on it. Maybe financial quotes. Or program code <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Have some specific ideas too, like creating tables with board game boards burned onto the surface and boxes for keeping gaming equipment (like Munchkin cards, figures, and dices).</p>
<h2>Electronics</h2>
<p>Despite I love technology and would be happy to have the latest laptop or desktop machines all the time my frugal mindset would not let this to happen. Moreover, I like old computers and just looking around in our basement and seeing those old motherboards, memories, processors and other stuff collecting dust makes me sad. Of course, I don&#8217;t throw them out because what if someday I will need them? And that day could come after reaching FIRE. These old computers are no more considered as cutting edge or fast or (according to my wife) usable at all. But what if they should not be. What if they should only fulfill a purpose which is manageable to them?</p>
<p>Back in the time when I was a kid (before the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/coders-of-finance-kickoff/">Commodore and console age</a>) in summers, we were not only attending the local riverbank beach to refresh ourselves in the river but to check if the &#8220;Luna Park&#8221; arrived. Just in case you have no clue about that, there&nbsp;were groups who were wandering through the neighboring countries and settle down for a couple of weeks every now and then. Their business was to bring a minimalistic feeling of an amusement park for a short period of time.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1048" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fun-2570737_640-300x200.jpg" alt="arcade" width="300" height="200">These visited us pretty regularly, every summer for a couple of weeks. There was a huge metal box (maybe made of some containers) equipped with a dozen arcade machines, flipper tables and even some slot machines (which seemed pretty boring to us back then).&nbsp;We spent many hours throwing coins into the arcade machines, driving cars, shooting balloons (sometimes bad guys or aliens), and helping Pacman to fill his stomach.&nbsp;Have to grab the opportunity to thank Mr. RIP who reminded me of this memory while I was reading through <a href="http://retireinprogress.com/mystory1/">his origin story</a>. As a tribute to these times and to put the dusting hardware (and some of the previously mentioned carpentry skills) into work these old machines&nbsp;with a little(?) bit of labor and hacking around could turn into fully functional arcade machines. Then after having enough fun with ourselves could be donated to some good causes. My sister volunteered at an orphanage this summer in Romania. I bet those kids could use some old school fun.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Of course, I am a coder and always will be. Even after reaching FIRE I can not imagine my life without writing some code or at least create some kind of software. They say every programmer prepares to be a game programmer and later enter reality. I am not any different, that was my dream also, but did not search that path intentionally and life never dropped the opportunity in my way. Once I would finish mandatory work on questionable projects I could freely indulge into game development. There is a chance it would be a hard nut to crack so maybe I would get a team of more talented folks and pour my vision of a history-based strategy game into reality. Edutainment FTW.</p>
<p>Picking up game programming skills would provide me with another benefit. Teaching kids programming is something I really would like to try sometime (even before reaching FIRE) and doing this through game programming&nbsp;would probably be the most engaging way of it.&nbsp;Back in my higher education years, I had some chances to tutoring my classmates whose programming (and/or logic thinking) skills were worse than mine. I liked it and discovered that explaining things to someone else deepen my understanding even more. A very rewarding opportunity and what could be more beneficial than planting the seed of the love of coding into young minds? Can not come up with anything better <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>Gastronomy</h2>
<figure id="attachment_1041" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1041" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1041 size-full" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/langos.jpg" alt="langos" width="512" height="384"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1041" class="wp-caption-text">by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Globetrotter19">Globetrotter19</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know a lot of us has the &#8220;Barista FIRE&#8221; path in mind and I would lie if I&#8217;d say that I never had plans on taking a course, learn to make mindblowing cocktails, and set up a beach bar at a sandy beach in Greece. Another option would be to bring our beloved Hungarian/Serbian cuisine abroad. Read an article just the other day about a place at a Japanese beach where you could buy &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ngos">l√°ngos</a>&#8220;. Unfortunately, the area got abandoned so the owner had to close it and move away. After that, he made the only logical next step. Opened another Hungarian restaurant&#8230; in Alaska. Sounds like a plan to me <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>Finally, the time would come to learn to play the guitar, get some fellows and form a punk band. Don&#8217;t expect any mainstream stuff, I only see two options. One is to revive the most popular tracks of our childhood. The other is to go full niche and find our voice. Every blogging course starts with this advice after all and music should be not any different. I guess in a world where cross-dressing fitness metal is a thing you cannot go too niche (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKwvtF1Y6Pw">check out if you dare</a>). As I have no interest in cross-dressing I would go with a much &#8220;closer to me&#8221; thing, nerd punk. If you have no idea what I am talking about check out this.</p>
<p><iframe title="&quot;Damage&quot; Music Video - 3d6" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/39vSWoXnf0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Have to admit that I never was so lucky to have the equipment or company to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons live so this could be another item on the FIRElist.</p>
<p>I am also a huge fantasy fan so a fantasy world themed band can be an option too. Like my new favorite, the Game-of-Thrones-themed nerd punk band, Daenerys and the Targaryens (must listen to GoT fans, check out both of their albums <a href="https://danyandthetargs.bandcamp.com">here</a>).</p>
<p><iframe title="&quot;Dracarys&quot; Daenerys &amp; the Targaryens at the Oriental" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nc_IP4MOevg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Or maybe simply turn the financial wisdom picked up through the years into lyrics? Who knows <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><em>That&#8217;s all for now. What do you think about these options? Are they too weird? Would you team up? Please share with me in the comments.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all,&nbsp;by FIREplace I meant the place where you retire to. I bet your instinctive answer to this question would be a huge YES. Also, probably you are already envisioning yourself enjoying the sun on a sandy beach in Spain, France or Italy. Or maybe you prefer indulging into the great fun what a capital city like London could offer? Or even would you just spend your time wandering around in the Alps in Switzerland or Germany? Riding a bike in Netherland or sweating in a sauna in Sweden? The list could go on and on. To be honest I cannot blame you and probably you are right.</p>
<p>But I want to discuss a different area today. We are heading to the eastern parts. As you may know, <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/escaping-the-matrix/">I am living in northern Serbia</a> so we will discuss local options. The numbers could be identical or pretty similar at least for other areas in the neighborhood. Narrow down this area to the places I know about from experience so let&#8217;s say my statements stand for Vojvodina (Serbia), Hungary and Transylvania (Romania).</p>
<p>Now it‚Äôs a fact that in the latest years this area is a not the place what comes to mind when you are thinking about where to move. People are leaving these ends in dozens every day searching for a better life in western Europe. I could not really point to a single family around here which does not have a member or a friend (or more) who works and lives abroad. The great majority is driven by financial reasons others by political or simply lifestyle preferences. Can not blame them, this area is not the best place for the average Joe for hoarding wealth. I would lie if I‚Äôd say I have never been tempted to leave. To be honest I am thinking about that option every now and then.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-991" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hitcher-1536748_1920-1024x681.jpg" alt="Hitcher" width="640" height="426"></p>
<p>Same time I always see people (unfortunately in very small numbers) who after living abroad for many long years finally gets defeated by homesickness and return to here. While that is a huge driving force there are other benefits of returning to the homeland after you have a steady pension or sufficient savings. In comparison to the states or even western Europe, this is a low-cost area.</p>
<p>Needs and wants in early retirement are very subjective things and highly affected by the lifestyle you used to live. I cannot promise that this area can provide you with everything, so for the sake of this thought experiment let‚Äôs assume that you are satisfied with what our little country could offer at other fields of life and let‚Äôs focus on the numbers. I will try to summarize the basic financial needs for living in the area looking for multiple options for spending ranges. So let&#8217;s see the &#8220;big three&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Housing</h2>
<p>There is the eternal debate of renting or buying but we will not cover that now. There are too many variables for every situation so let&#8217;s get some examples for both.&nbsp;This place is no different than others, the rental prices are highly dependent on the location and the type of the property.</p>
<h3>Renting</h3>
<p>If you are ok with living in the countryside you can find cheap accommodation in villages or small towns. The only problem here is to find a suitable property (the renting out culture is not that widely spread here). There is a chance that you will not find a flat in such areas but if you can find a house for rent you can probably get it for $70-$150/month. I heard about folks who were able to get a rental and not paying a dime for it just taking care of the place (while the owners were working abroad).</p>
<p>Small-medium sized cities are a little bit more expensive but also could offer more entertainment by the western standards. There is a chance that you can choose from a bigger assortment. From real-life examples, I could say that you can find a studio apartment (around 375sqft) for $100-$150, a medium-sized (around 540sqft) for $150-$300, and a big one (above 1000sqft) for $300-$500 per month. Rental houses are not as frequent here as they should be (trust me we were searching for one with no luck) but where you can find some the prices would be similar to flat rentals only houses can be found at more distant locations.</p>
<p>Big cities are the ones which I would avoid at any costs, but if you insist and want to find a reasonable and acceptable flat you would probably shell out similar amounts as in the western countries. The variability is so high that I would not even try to guesstimate exact numbers, but it could be anywhere above $500 and the sky is the limit.</p>
<h3>Buying</h3>
<p>Following the same distinction at smaller places, you can find properties for even a couple thousand dollars. I heard about whole farms which were bought for less than $10k (taxes and other expenses included). A good estimation for average house prices at these places is on the $10k-$30k scale depending on the size.</p>
<p>In medium-sized cities, flat prices vary from $750-$1250 per square meter (10sqft). Seemingly the real estate market is growing finally, there are a dozen constructions going on just in our city so we could say that there is a nice assortment. From my experience house prices for acceptable properties with average sizes (around 1500sqft home size on a 5000-7500sqft plot) would cost you $45k-$70k.</p>
<p>For big cities the situation is the same as for rentals, the prices could be similar to western mid-size places. Anyway assume a number north of the upper limits of the previous paragraph.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-994" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/house-970344_1920-1024x678.jpg" alt="House" width="640" height="424"></p>
<h3>Utilities</h3>
<p>In terms of utilities, I can only speak about my (and my peers) experiences. We used to live in a flat and our monthly bills added up to $110 per month on average. When we moved to our house our expenses rosed a bit thanks to heating bills. Electricity, water + sewer costs, waste removal, natural gas, landline + internet for our household averages around $200 per month. Your location does not really affect these numbers, the size of your home does.</p>
<h2>Transportation</h2>
<p>You should know two things about public transportation in Serbia. The first thing is that the tickets are not expensive. The second thing is that as a bonus you get an instant time travel 50 years back. While there are exceptions most vehicles are remainings of the last century and a lot of them are older than me.</p>
<h3>Railways</h3>
<p>My grandfather told me nice stories about the great Yugoslavian railways. <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/three-financial-lessons/">I wrote about him earlier</a> and told you that he was a &#8220;gastarbeiter&#8221; in Germany and he used the railways back then. The huge problem is that if you are not living in the middle of the country (around the capital city, Belgrade) if you see a newer train it is probably a foreign one. The rest of them are the same ones my grandpa used.</p>
<p>I had some friends who commuted to school by train. The rule was that if the train was not able to start in the morning the railway&nbsp;company provided an excuse to them for skipping the school that day. Once I was waiting for my train departure at 7&#8217;o clock in the morning. The first news was about a ten minute late. At 2 PM&nbsp;I gave up and went home. So, definitely not recommended for a daily commute.</p>
<p>Before I totally scare you away from using the railways in Serbia I have to tell that as a rule of thumb the longer the line of travel and the more international the line is the higher the probability is that the trip will actually happen. I used to travel a couple of times from the top of Serbia all the way down to the shores of the Adriatic sea in Montenegro for roughly 50 bucks. Also, if you want to experience the true essence of the Balkans I really recommend taking longer trips by train here. Expect something like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raby3rkC7Do">this video</a>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Bus companies</h3>
<p>As the glory of the railways was fading bus companies were breaking forth just to step on the same path. Again there are exceptions. As a rule of thumb the bigger the company is and have long and/or international lines the newer and better are the vehicles. The oldest ones are running between smaller towns and in public transport in small-medium sized cities. I remember a movie about the Montgomery bus boycott. Well, today I was traveling on a similar vehicle, maybe a little bit dirtier <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Again, prices are in correlation with the quality of the service. A local one-way bus ticket is $0.9, the monthly ticket is $25. Interurban lines are selling for roughly $0.15/mile. The exceptions are the international lines like the one to Austria. These are newer vehicles and a one-way ticket is $45. Tourist agencies have also good vehicles and fair prices, you can buy a return ticket to Chalkidiki, Greece for $70-80 per person.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-992" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bus-2423983_1920-695x1024.jpg" alt="Bus" width="640" height="943"></p>
<h3>Taxy &amp; Uber..ish companies</h3>
<p>Uber is non-existent over here but has some local flavors like&nbsp;<a href="http://appcargo.net/">CarGo</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.rs.blablacar.gg/">BlaBlaCar</a>. These are unfortunately usable only in bigger cities but you can find a taxi at pretty much every town. The prices are around $0.8 per km which I consider relatively cheap compared to western fares.</p>
<h3>Car ownership</h3>
<p>This is a topic worth a separate post alone so, for now, I would only tell that new car prices are relatively high, cars are not cheaper than in the western countries where salaries are multiples of ours. This sucks, I know but we are frugal folks after all so we buy only new to us cars, right?</p>
<p>Again a topic for a different day, but in terms of the used car market, you can buy a reliable smaller hatchback for $5-7k which can serve for a decade at least. Expect higher fuel prices than over the pond, still, if you travel in a group this could be a more economical option. If I don&#8217;t take the purchase price into account just the fuel and maintenance costs a family of four could probably travel by car for less (half-price to same cost range) than a bus ticket on a specific distance.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>And last but not least we reached the biggest positive factor in living here. As in a dominantly agricultural area, the local ingredients are relatively cheap and high in quality. Would not make a list myself here, but bumped into <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/food-prices/country_result.jsp?country=Serbia&amp;displayCurrency=USD">this great statistic site</a> lately. If you follow the link you can find a pretty accurate list from the basics and you can estimate your expenses based on your grocery buying habits. Let&#8217;s see some actual tips how should you get your food.</p>
<h3>Straight from the producer</h3>
<p>At almost every place there is someone who knows someone who produces this or that. While this is not an option for everyone if you can discover such a channel respect it as you probably found gold. This is the way to get the highest quality for the lowest price especially if you buy in bulk or if you become a loyal customer. If you are going through a village or small town and you see goods on a table or in buckets next to the road look for the owner, they will happy to serve you and even jump into juicy negotiations. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Farmers market</h3>
<p>The second best option and the best for the ones who like to do regular grocery shopping tours and get everything in one place. Vegetables, fruits, meat products and diaries are high in variability and the prices are good. The only important thing here is to always try to discover producers and try to avoid wholesalers to get the best quality for your money. Also, don&#8217;t really believe if you see an organic or bio label on anything. This trend is just conquering these parts and not totally respected by producers. I know about farmers who said when someone asked what is the difference between the bio and not bio versions that the non-bio producers are using chemicals by daylight&#8230;</p>
<h3>Supermarkets &amp; Hypermarkets</h3>
<p>These are offering pretty much everything exactly like anywhere else. The assortment is abundant, local stuff is dominant but you can find all the world-class brands and products. You should buy in bulk here everything you do not manage to get at the first two options.</p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-993" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/barbecue-1239145_1920-1024x778.jpg" alt="Meat" width="640" height="486"></h3>
<h3>Local food</h3>
<p>Ok, we reached even the most interesting part of this section. Similarly to cars this worth a separate post alone. If you are curious about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_cuisine">detailed list of the Serbian cuisine you can find it here</a>. Bakeries are the go to places in the morning to enjoy a full-filling burek (although not the healthiest choice) with jog(no h here)urt of course (for roughly $1.5-$2). Grill bars are literally everywhere, every little town has at least one of them. Unfortunately, they are renovating them to look more like fast food restaurants. Still, the end product is the same: tasty grilled meats and plenty of fresh veggies. You have to visit these places at lunch AND dinnertime ($2-$5/per meal). Yes, as you may be guessed your stomach <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/serbia/articles/11-traditional-serbian-dishes-you-need-to-try/">will be pampered here</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Oh, and at the end of the day you could still have only $10-$15 spent.</p>
<h3>Restaurants</h3>
<p>As a closing accord, I have to say that most of the restaurants over here are pretty good. They serve tasty meals for reasonable prices and most of the times the amounts are more than plenty. Of course in bigger cities, you could go for maximum fanciness at stellar prices but a reasonable small-middle sized city can offer you a very good quality and huge portions for around $5-$10 per meal. Even if I take into account the best restaurant in our town if you don&#8217;t pick something exotic (like sea-fish) you could fill your stomach for $8-$20. Add a glass of excellent local wine or artisan beer which would add another $3-$5 to the bill. Sounds tempting?</p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Living at our ends has its pros and cons just like any other place. This area is definitely not the best place for chasing FIRE. The only exception is if you can take advantage of geoarbitrage like hundreds of local companies and especially thousands of freelancers who provide high-quality professional services for the western world for western salaries. But as you were able to realize for now if you find the environment, the culture and the people over here a fit for your taste the countries of central-eastern Europe can be a tempting choice as a FIREplace. If nothing more, definitely worth an extended visit after you reached FIRE <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><em>What about you? Would you be able to retire to such a place? Do these numbers make these end tempting for FIREd folks? Share your ideas in the comments! See you soon.</em></p>
