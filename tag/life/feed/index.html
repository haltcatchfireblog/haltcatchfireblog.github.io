										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I turned 33 yesterday. Don’t know about you, but for me, this is the time for self-reflection. If I have a couple minutes of silent free time (which is very rare) all these questions flush my mind immediately. Where am I? Am I satisfied with my life? Am I on the good track? What did I mess up? What are my goals? What are my options? Etc…</p>
<p>If you have read some of my <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/archives/">posts</a> so far you probably know that I am an average guy in many aspects. Ok, I know that being average is relative so let&#8217;s say I am average by my standards. We have a house and a car, both modest, nothing fancy, just by our means. My job is one of the best in town, both in terms of nature of the work and salary. Not too easy, not too hard. I am not over neither underpaid. I can go on and on with every aspect and on most fields, the statements would be the same.</p>
<p>Then there is the question of satisfaction and gratitude. Am I satisfied with my life? Well, the correct answer is &#8220;Yes and No”. When I look at where I am currently I have to tell that I am satisfied. I have a lovely wife. Two adorable daughters. A loving family. I can check every aspect of life and I can say that we are doing ok. Thus, I can say that I am extremely grateful for all of this. Then I start to look and think about the possibilities and suddenly everything gets a different light.</p>
<figure id="attachment_448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-448" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-448" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/animal-17474_1920-1024x947.jpg" alt="Thinking Monkey" width="400" height="370"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-448" class="wp-caption-text">A selfie from me while writing this post</figcaption></figure>
<p>To be honest this aspect started to show up before my eyes since one day I bumped into the personal finance blogosphere. Until that, I thought that I am killing it. Then I was facing all the awesome things other people are chasing (and more importantly successfully chasing), let it be financial independence, early retirement, mini-retirement, traveling the world, spending huge amount of time with the kiddos and loved ones, becoming freelancers and entrepreneurs, help other people and in some cases change the world. These things just blew my mind. And I stopped feeling that I am killing it.</p>
<p>Since then I am on the everlasting quest of devouring information about improvement. I always liked to read, but these days I read more than ever before. And I know that this is good, but to put this information into action is a totally different story. Reading about making a change is easy, actually changing things is not. Falling into the trap of eternal planning and constant procrastination is a real threat. Forming plans and then let them fade away into the greyness of everyday life. Letting everything to just levitate in this chaotic structure called schedule.</p>
<p>Then something happens (like a birthday), you enter this state of mind called self-reflection and suddenly you start to question everything. What do you do? Why do you do it? Is it right? Does it worth it? And you realize that you don’t have exact answers. Sometimes I feel that everything is fine. I provide stability to my family both emotionally and financially. But then sometimes I ask myself if I could do better? And the obvious answers is a big bold YES. Which leads to the next rational question, why don’t you do it then? Now this question is a harder nut to crack.</p>
<p>Yesterday I bumped into <a href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/reducing-emotional-stress/">this article</a> from Sam, listened to it, then watched the TED video in the end. Needless to say, I was amazed, as always hearing a story about someone who starts from a disadvantageous situation and reaches great success. Then the question comes to your mind every time “What is your excuse?”. Damn, even one of the most successful (if not THE most successful) blogger on earth, Jon Morrow has an illness which makes him unable to move his body below his neck. And there are hundreds of other examples.</p>
<p>So what is my excuse not chasing my dreams fanatically? What is the difference which gave these people the motivation to achieve everything they want? Well, the answer for this is different in every story, but there is a pattern. And to come to this conclusion I had to turn the question upside down. What causes my lack of motivation to chase greater goals? The answer came instantly as always when you find the right question to ask. It does not hurt enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Good enough is the enemy of greatness.</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>When you are thinking about your things and you label everything as good enough this leads to two things. On one side you will be grateful for your situation, but as you will not be extremely grateful it often fell out of focus. You will be motivated to achieve more, but as you are not obliged to do so it is very easy to step back when bigger obstacles come your way. (Or is it just me? :))</p>
<p>So while it is cool to have a “good enough” life same time it can also prevent you from achieving more. Probably that’s why it took me almost a year to finally start a blog. And that’s why I have problems keeping myself consistent with it. Whatever, I believe this is the root of the problem.</p>
<p>The next rational question is that what can we do about it? Well, the source of motivation can be different for everyone. I found it in my relationship with my children. To provide a better life for them. One with more happiness, more fulfillment and more options to them. This is something I think worth working for. So I am here. On the quest for learning new skills. To prove myself that I can be consistent. To prove others that I can fight for my dreams. And to break the chains of mediocrity and aim for getting better.</p>
<p><em>Sorry if this post is a little bit chaotic and messed up. I am kind of sick’n’tired and my head is dizzy. These flowing thoughts disturbed me and I wanted to get them off of the top of my head. I hope that next week I will be able to get you a proper, more entertaining story.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I reported <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/funny-friday-kids-edition/">last week</a>, <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/who-killed-my-halloween/">Halloween</a> passed without any sign. But there is another ritual which is more common at our ends. Every year on the 1st and 2nd of November we visit cemeteries to bring some flowers, light candles, pray and remember our loved ones who are not walking amongst us anymore.</p>
<p>As a kid this was an interesting event. I remember that we were walking around with my grandfather between the graves. While we were cleaning up a little bit, placed the flowers and candles he was telling stories about my great grandparents and other relatives whom I never know. Most of the times the weather was chilly but sunny, the cemetery was peaceful and we were having a great time together. When we finished we always bought a liter of roasted chestnuts which they start to make and sell first time in the year.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years later I am wandering between their graves with my daughter and I tell stories about them who she cannot remember. She is kind of enjoying it, as I did when I was young, innocent and while I never faced the death of a loved one. After the first encounter stepping through the door of the cemetery was never the same. Time heals the scars, but the grief stays with us forever. Fortunately the good memories too.</p>
<p>I feel lucky, because I have my parents and one of my grandmothers still around. God bless them. But I have also experienced the loss of a couple of persons who were close to me. This year while walking by their graves suddenly a question popped into my mind. What can I learn from them? From their lives and deaths? What would they teach me if they had the chance to speak to me once more? Every one of them could give some interesting lessons, I bet. But I can rely only on my imagination and my memories. Let me share you two of these special stories.</p>
<h2>The first encounter</h2>
<p>It was a sunny, early summer morning. The year is 1999. The summer vacation started a couple of weeks earlier because of the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/escaping-the-matrix/">NATO bombing</a>. But this morning was good, the sirens remained silent, my parents was out on errands and I just installed another good game on my PC (maybe Age Of Empires 2?). It was around 11&#8217;o clock when my father and my mother entered my room in a rush. My mother was unable to say anything just crying. When I asked them what happened my father answered in a crooked voice and told me that my grandmother died that morning.</p>
<p>Needless to say I was shocked. This was my first close encounter with death and grief. And I did not really know how to handle it. I started to cry, went into denial and felt that kind of sadness which I have never felt before. The following days are blurry and even this day it is painful to recall the events. She was the closest to me after my parents. I have spent a huge amount of time with her. Both of my parents were working by then, and in the earlier days my grandfather too. She was the &#8220;stay at home grandma&#8221; in the family. Their house was closer to the school so I was sleeping there several times a week. After school went back and had lunch there. She was an excellent cook too. I can tell that she was my second mother.</p>
<p>There is a memory which is living vividly in my mind. Two days before that morning after lunch I headed home. I said goodbye and rushed to the door. I cannot remember the reason, but I was in a hurry. When reached the door I heard my name and turned around. She was standing there at the top of the stairs and staring at me with a smile. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you give a kiss to your grandma?&#8221; she asked. Suddenly I felt ashamed. Ran back to her, hugged her and kissed her. &#8220;I love you grandma&#8221; I told her. She was smiling and silently said &#8220;I know, me too&#8221;. That was the last time I have seen her alive. And I cannot be more grateful for this memory.</p>
<p>She was kind, understanding and gave me everything I need. But the biggest life lesson I have learned from her death was that last memory. If you love someone let them know and let them feel it. Every. Single. Day. Take every opportunity to do so. You never know when will be the last chance.</p>
<h2>The unexpected</h2>
<p>A couple of years ago I got a phone call from my mom. She told me that she heard that one of my childhood friends died. At first, I was skeptical. He was around 25 at the time, in great condition and despite our lives went on different paths we still had a beer sometimes. It was surreal. I have to admit that same I thought that I would not be surprised if this horrible thing would be true as he was kind of a “Live fast die young” type of person, at least in their rebel teenage years. After a couple of phone calls it turned out that it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>We knew each other since we were kids, but only became close friends later when we attended the same folk dance group. The rest of the boys were around my age and we saw him as a little brother. We taught him about life what we knew (or what we thought we knew, we were barely teenagers). He had problems in those rebel years, but who did not? In the end, he fought his demons and became a strong, positive person.</p>
<p>He was the ultimate joker, there was nothing he was not able to make fun of it. Man, how much we laughed. The girls adored him. He had the balls, did things which we did not have the courage to do. On positive ways of course. At least most of the times <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If he had an idea did not rest until made it happen. He studied astronomy, trained capoeira, played drum N bass as a Dj and tried many more things.</p>
<p>Once he met a Ukranian girl on Facebook, fell in love, packed his backpack and traveled through half of Europe to meet her. After an adventurous trip, he arrived at the Crimea peninsula (this was before the Russian incident) and spent the following weeks traveling around with her. They collected memories and have seen interesting things.</p>
<p>He always had a good physique and was healthy. This made more unbelievable that he had a hidden heart disease which led to his early death. I miss him. He showed us that you have to question things, that sometimes a little bit more courage can lead to wonderful things and that you should never afraid of trying out new things.</p>
<p>His death also made me realize that life is not eternal and it can end in a blink of an eye without warning. So we better use our given time wisely and not waste any of it. In a way, he lived more in that short period of time than others in a century of a lifetime.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-416" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/candles-300x200.jpg" alt="Candles" width="500" height="333"></p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Strangely, while walking between their graves now, sadness is not the strongest feeling in my heart. Gratitude is. I am thankful that I knew them. That they were part of my life. That they had an impact on my life. And that their loving memories along with the lessons they taught will remain with me until my time comes to follow them to the other side.</p>
<p><em>Rest in peace.</em></p>
