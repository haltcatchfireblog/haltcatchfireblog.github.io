										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I turned 33 yesterday. Don’t know about you, but for me, this is the time for self-reflection. If I have a couple minutes of silent free time (which is very rare) all these questions flush my mind immediately. Where am I? Am I satisfied with my life? Am I on the good track? What did I mess up? What are my goals? What are my options? Etc…</p>
<p>If you have read some of my <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/archives/">posts</a> so far you probably know that I am an average guy in many aspects. Ok, I know that being average is relative so let&#8217;s say I am average by my standards. We have a house and a car, both modest, nothing fancy, just by our means. My job is one of the best in town, both in terms of nature of the work and salary. Not too easy, not too hard. I am not over neither underpaid. I can go on and on with every aspect and on most fields, the statements would be the same.</p>
<p>Then there is the question of satisfaction and gratitude. Am I satisfied with my life? Well, the correct answer is &#8220;Yes and No”. When I look at where I am currently I have to tell that I am satisfied. I have a lovely wife. Two adorable daughters. A loving family. I can check every aspect of life and I can say that we are doing ok. Thus, I can say that I am extremely grateful for all of this. Then I start to look and think about the possibilities and suddenly everything gets a different light.</p>
<figure id="attachment_448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-448" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-448" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/animal-17474_1920-1024x947.jpg" alt="Thinking Monkey" width="400" height="370"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-448" class="wp-caption-text">A selfie from me while writing this post</figcaption></figure>
<p>To be honest this aspect started to show up before my eyes since one day I bumped into the personal finance blogosphere. Until that, I thought that I am killing it. Then I was facing all the awesome things other people are chasing (and more importantly successfully chasing), let it be financial independence, early retirement, mini-retirement, traveling the world, spending huge amount of time with the kiddos and loved ones, becoming freelancers and entrepreneurs, help other people and in some cases change the world. These things just blew my mind. And I stopped feeling that I am killing it.</p>
<p>Since then I am on the everlasting quest of devouring information about improvement. I always liked to read, but these days I read more than ever before. And I know that this is good, but to put this information into action is a totally different story. Reading about making a change is easy, actually changing things is not. Falling into the trap of eternal planning and constant procrastination is a real threat. Forming plans and then let them fade away into the greyness of everyday life. Letting everything to just levitate in this chaotic structure called schedule.</p>
<p>Then something happens (like a birthday), you enter this state of mind called self-reflection and suddenly you start to question everything. What do you do? Why do you do it? Is it right? Does it worth it? And you realize that you don’t have exact answers. Sometimes I feel that everything is fine. I provide stability to my family both emotionally and financially. But then sometimes I ask myself if I could do better? And the obvious answers is a big bold YES. Which leads to the next rational question, why don’t you do it then? Now this question is a harder nut to crack.</p>
<p>Yesterday I bumped into <a href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/reducing-emotional-stress/">this article</a> from Sam, listened to it, then watched the TED video in the end. Needless to say, I was amazed, as always hearing a story about someone who starts from a disadvantageous situation and reaches great success. Then the question comes to your mind every time “What is your excuse?”. Damn, even one of the most successful (if not THE most successful) blogger on earth, Jon Morrow has an illness which makes him unable to move his body below his neck. And there are hundreds of other examples.</p>
<p>So what is my excuse not chasing my dreams fanatically? What is the difference which gave these people the motivation to achieve everything they want? Well, the answer for this is different in every story, but there is a pattern. And to come to this conclusion I had to turn the question upside down. What causes my lack of motivation to chase greater goals? The answer came instantly as always when you find the right question to ask. It does not hurt enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Good enough is the enemy of greatness.</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>When you are thinking about your things and you label everything as good enough this leads to two things. On one side you will be grateful for your situation, but as you will not be extremely grateful it often fell out of focus. You will be motivated to achieve more, but as you are not obliged to do so it is very easy to step back when bigger obstacles come your way. (Or is it just me? :))</p>
<p>So while it is cool to have a “good enough” life same time it can also prevent you from achieving more. Probably that’s why it took me almost a year to finally start a blog. And that’s why I have problems keeping myself consistent with it. Whatever, I believe this is the root of the problem.</p>
<p>The next rational question is that what can we do about it? Well, the source of motivation can be different for everyone. I found it in my relationship with my children. To provide a better life for them. One with more happiness, more fulfillment and more options to them. This is something I think worth working for. So I am here. On the quest for learning new skills. To prove myself that I can be consistent. To prove others that I can fight for my dreams. And to break the chains of mediocrity and aim for getting better.</p>
<p><em>Sorry if this post is a little bit chaotic and messed up. I am kind of sick’n’tired and my head is dizzy. These flowing thoughts disturbed me and I wanted to get them off of the top of my head. I hope that next week I will be able to get you a proper, more entertaining story.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&lt;offtopic&gt;This is not connecting to this Funny Friday episode, so you can skip it if you want. Earlier this week I wrote about my <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/who-killed-my-halloween/">relationship with Halloween</a> and that finally, I accepted it. Then it passed by without a single sign. This year I have seen no decorations, except in a supermarket. No kids in costumes wandering the streets and no one rang our bell for trick-or-treating. I was surprised and still don’t know why. Maybe never will.&lt;/offtopic&gt;</p>
<p>This week Sam over at Financial Samurai published a post with the title <a href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-stop-worrying-about-childs-future/">How To Stop Worrying About Your Child’s Future In This Competitive World</a>. I will not discuss the post in depth, go and read, worth the time. Also, I want to note that, despite the debate escalated about if he over-worries his son’s future, I agree with him in every detail. Maybe I am overstressing this topic too, but to be honest my whole journey into personal finance was kickstarted by the birth of my first daughter.</p>
<p>When I first held my daughter in my arms I realized that life will never be the same again and that now I have someone whom I will worry until the day I die. Four years later I have another one girl to worry about. And my mindset about stability and security changed entirely. This is a Funny Friday post, so I will not go into the details (keep them for a future post). Instead here are a handful of memes about the things popped into my mind about this topic. Don’t try to search for a storyline or any structure, this is an “off the top of my head” type of list.</p>
<h2>Negotiating</h2>
<p>Kids are extremely good in negotiating. Especially if it is about going to bed or eating another slice of chocolate. We should embrace this skill in them instead of suppressing it. What if they would be aware of their financial situation?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-408" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_negotiating.jpg" alt="Funny-Fiday-7-Negotiation" width="750" height="500"></p>
<h2>Practice what you preach</h2>
<p>Like it or not, we are role models to them at least in the early years. Don’t let the lack of interest or attention they keep an eye on your every single move and record everything. Knowing this it is extremely important to practice what you preach.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-407" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_loan.jpg" alt="Practice what you preach - Loan" width="500" height="902"></p>

<h2>Finances</h2>
<p>You will be responsible for teaching the basic concepts of life, relationships, and finances to them properly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-405" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_concepts.jpg" alt="Basic concepts - FIRE" width="468" height="615"></p>
<h2>Careers</h2>
<p>While you should not force them to choose a career path you prefer, you should totally give them advice and try to protect them from stepping on the wrong path.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-406" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_career.jpg" alt="Career choice" width="494" height="688"></p>
<h2>Family business</h2>
<p>Creating a family business, teaching them valuable lessons and then when the time comes passing down the keys to them is an absolutely good thing in my opinion. My father is working in the family business which was started by my grandfather (imagine nothing fancy, there are two workers, he and my grandma). After working for others for 20+ years and got laid down in a very inappropriate way, this was the thing which made him able to provide a living for his family.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-401" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_takeover.jpg" alt="Family Business Takeover" width="526" height="394"></p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Taking the compound interest into account even this blog could develop into a valuable asset which I could leave as an inheritance to my children (or grandchildren). How cool would it be to hand down the site to them?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-402" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_get_a_job.jpg" alt="Get a real job!" width="500" height="500"></p>
