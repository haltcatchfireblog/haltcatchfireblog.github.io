										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Hello everyone. As you could be noticed I have shared some guest post about various topics like <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/prepping-for-non-preppers-101/">prepping</a> or the new <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/america-is-no-longer-the-land-of-opportunity/">land of opportunity</a>. I have no intentions to turn this blog into the go-to place when you have to look for general financial wisdom, there are loads of other blogs which fulfill this mission much better than mine so I try to keep this (my) corner of the internet a funny place where geeky finance nerds can hang out (or at least that&#8217;s the plan).</em></p>
<p><em>The same time that does not mean that every now and then I could not publish some general wisdom about financial topics, especially when someone offers it on a silver plate <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> That was the case when a fellow blogger pinged me if I accept guests posts. Her topic is a little bit more serious but as someone who is seeing the effects of being in debt on loved ones, I found it important to take my part in helping to spread the word.</em></p>
<p><em>Nerd alert: there are links to some cute calculators! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>

<hr>
<p>Living debt free is everyoneâ€™s dream. But, is it always a feasible option? Probably not. We need to take out loans to have a better lifestyle. But it doesn&#8217;t mean that weâ€™d have to continue with our debt payments throughout our life. We can still opt for a debt-free lifestyle.</p>
<h2>What is it like to be debt free?</h2>
<p>It requires no mention that being debt free is awesome. What are the other advantages?</p>
<h3>You can save more of your hard-earned income</h3>
<p>When you don&#8217;t have to make the interest payments, you can save more. And, what will you do with the savings? You can save for your retirement and achieve FIRE (Financial Independence and Retirement Early) at your desired time.</p>
<p>Even if youâ€™re not saving for early retirement, you can at least use the money for your pleasure or invest for profitable returns in the future.</p>
<h3>You can live a stress-free life</h3>
<p>Life with debt is always stressful. Every time when you plan a budget or make some financial plan, you have to keep aside an amount to repay debts.</p>
<p>Once you don&#8217;t owe anything to others, youâ€™re not much affected by the recession. If you have an emergency fund, you know that you can sustain for at least a few months even if your income decreases to some extent or thereâ€™s an inflation.</p>
<p>So, you have a higher quality of life.</p>
<h3>You can get your desired lifestyle</h3>
<p>The most annoying part of being in debt is that you have to pay for the expenses you made in the past. Once you start living a debt free lifestyle, you can use your money for the needs you have today and in the future.</p>
<p>It is a sense of empowerment since you can decide how much you need to allow for your present needs and wants and how much to keep to fulfill the needs of the future.</p>
<h3>You can build a better financial future</h3>
<p>When you make only the minimum payments on credit card debts, it creates an avalanche as unpaid balance gets added up every month. However, living a debt free life also helps to create an avalanche, but a positive one.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>You can increase your savings and make investments with your paycheck, thus <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/how-to-get-over-your-financial-hangover/">building a good financial future</a>.</p>
<h2>How can you achieve a debt-free lifestyle?</h2>
<p>First of all, let me tell you that youâ€™d have to work for that. But, itâ€™s not that tough. Many people have been successful and you can achieve it too.</p>
<p>We have to choose a debt-free lifestyle and then gradually, it will become a habit. Once we start doing something consciously, it becomes a habit after a certain time.</p>
<p>Once you decide to live debt free and have a positive mindset, you donâ€™t have to struggle hard as implementing the habits become relatively easier.</p>
<p>So, letâ€™s find out how to implement the habit of living a life without debt. Here are a few debt-free living tips for you:</p>
<h3>Understand and accept the challenges</h3>
<p>Once you decide to live debt free and take the necessary steps, be prepared to hear that you are foolish and people will ask why you are taking such steps.</p>
<p>Be ready to accept the challenge. The road wonâ€™t be smooth. But, once your lifestyle choice becomes a habit, things will be easier for you and youâ€™ll be motivated to attain your goal.</p>
<p>So, make yourself ready to accept the challenge of <a href="http://time.com/money/4299020/debt-free-happy/">living a debt-free lifestyle</a>.</p>
<h3>Create a big gap between your income and expenditure</h3>
<p>The prime aspect of paying back debt is to save more and more and use the amount to repay dues. The more you can widen the gap between your income and expenses, the faster you can embrace a life without debt bothering you.</p>
<p>So, what do you need to do?</p>
<p>Plan a budget and embrace frugality. That doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™d have to be a miser. But, use money as per your needs and not wants.</p>
<h3>Try to avoid an inflated lifestyle</h3>
<p>Expenses always increase because we try to imitate othersâ€™ lifestyle. Try to avoid that. Whenever you feel your expenses are increasing, remember your goal of being debt free. Develop the habit of not stretching your finances too much to please your peer group.</p>
<p>Instead of being pressurized to spend more, motivate your friends to try living a debt-free lifestyle.</p>
<h3>Learn to say a â€˜Noâ€™ whenever itâ€™s needed</h3>
<p>Saying â€˜Noâ€™ is a bit difficult, especially when your close friends tell you something. However, make it clear that youâ€™re living on a limited budget and they should encourage you to follow that.</p>
<p>If theyâ€™re real friends, theyâ€™ll help you to become debt free.</p>
<h3>Plan long-term goals and assess periodically</h3>
<p>You know where youâ€™re heading to when you have a goal and work towards it. So, plan long-term goals and assess your progress periodically.</p>
<p>You may not be successful in your first attempt. But, developing the habit of making goals and planning strategies will surely make you attain your dreams.</p>
<h3>Select a suitable debt-free strategy</h3>
<p>Gather knowledge about suitable debt relief options and choose the best one for you. You can select from professional debt relief options along with DIY strategies to repay your unpaid balances.</p>
<p>If you want to have an idea whether or not your debts are within the manageable limit, you can check out with a <a href="https://www.debtconsolidationcare.com/calculator/debtincomeratio.html">debt-to-income ratio calculator</a> available online.</p>
<p>And, if you are overburdened with debts, you can use a <a href="https://www.debtconsolidationcare.com/calculator/settlement.html">debt settlement calculator</a> to find out how much you can save and how long itâ€™ll take to get rid of your unsecured debts.</p>
<p>Whatever option you choose, first of all, cultivate a debt free mindset. Always think how life will be after you pay back every single cent, and donâ€™t stop in your mission until you pay back the last cent.</p>
<h2>Habits of people living a debt-free lifestyle</h2>
<p>Here are the habits of people who lead a life without debt:</p>
<ul>
<li>They allow every dollar a task; the allotted dollar for savings is used for that purpose only.</li>
<li>They do not pay heed to peer pressure; theyâ€™re always focused towards their monetary goals.</li>
<li>They are always financially prepared for the unexpected expenses; they have their emergency fund ready to tackle such expenses.</li>
<li>They set a limit beyond which they don&#8217;t charge their credit cards; if required, they repay a certain amount and then swipe the cards again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following all these tips and strategies, and by managing your finances properly, not only itâ€™ll become a habit of living a debt-free life, but also you can be assured of living debt free in retirement, too.</p>
<p>So, embrace these habits and step into a better financial future.</p>

I think I don&#8217;t have to say anything else.</em></p>
<p><em>Take it over brent.</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Brent and I grew up in British Columbia, Canada (various places). I work full time from my home in Saskatoon, Canada and live with my wife Betty. I enjoy blogging, coding, and writing; spent most of my youth, and young adulthood chasing the dream of financial freedom via the music business &#8211; I failed on every level imaginable &#8211; first marriage, dreams of musical success, my jobs, and my first attempts at Internet marketing.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">The Beginning</h2>
<h3><strong>When was your first encounter with computing?</strong></h3>
<p>In my father&#8217;s basement when I was a young child. I can&#8217;t remember the computer he started on, but I know he was writing with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC language</a>. There was no Internet back then, and I remember him using a lot of books he got from the library. He loved it.</p>
<p>Eventually, he went on to write programs for the company he worked for, and he tried other languages as well. I was fascinated with it, and he tried to show me the rudimentary structure of a computer.</p>
<h3><strong>What was your first machine?</strong></h3>
<p>Commodore 64C &#8211; with a monitor AND floppy disk! It was heaven. Green screen and all. My Dad was into Apple by then, so there was the ongoing discussion of what machine is better, etc. He was much better than I was, and he was 100% self-taught.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-895" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/C64-1024x520.png" alt="C64" width="640" height="325"></p>
<h3><strong>Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</strong></h3>
<p>Gaming at first, but soon after I was playing around with DOS. Never really became fluent in any language, but I still loved how code worked, and the possibilities it promised.</p>
<h3><strong>What about education? Was it related to computing? Did you learn in the traditional way? What kind of degree do you have?</strong></h3>
<p>None really of substance. I took an electronics technician course for a year (which I almost failed due to playing in the band and getting wasted) at <a style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;" href="http://camosun.ca/">Camosun College in Victoria</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">, and computers and computing language were part of the curriculum.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Career</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>When did you start to work? Was it in your field? How was it?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Until I was 23 I never had a full-time job, as I was pursuing a music career. I worked in restaurants washing dishes, prep-cooking, cleaning, etc.</p>
<h3><strong>What are your experiences about the industry?</strong></h3>
<p>Music was my first career. I played bars, wrote music, recorded music, and went on the road. I met a lot of interesting people and shared the stage (backing them up or playing with) with punk bands and eventually more musically accomplished bands (<strong>WARNING:</strong> <em>name drop time</em>). In punk rock we backed up D.O.A., The SubHumans, Husker Du &#8211; in the <a href="https://livevictoria.com/index.php?band_action=info&amp;bandid=22925">Trouble Boys</a> we backed up John Lee Hooker, The Heats from Seattle (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0raxefoB8Nc">CHECK THE HEATS OUT HERE!</a> &#8211; play in background &#8211; can you believe these guys never made it!), traded live guitar solos with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN1xzwt6oyA">Jerry Doucette</a> one time. I met some names like Bryan Adams, Loverboy, BTO, HeadPins, on the west coast of Canada. Later in the prairies I released a couple of solo albums and played with some other big Canadian players, and we backed up Blue Rodeo on the river once (that was fucking cool!) &#8211; it was a ton of fun, but I finally had to let it all go.</p>
<p>NO MONEY IN IT!</p>
<p>When I turned 23 my parents scraped me off the streets of Vancouver and I started an apprenticeship in aviation as a mechanic. That was my first real paying career until I was 42 years old.</p>
<p>Aviation was amazing at first. When I started with the airlines at the age of 27 I was single and had flight benefits for $5 a flight to anywhere in the world. It was really exciting &#8211; flying anywhere you wanted &#8211; free drinks and food on the plane, and buddy passes I could give to friends (some girls too!).</p>
<p>But that all wore off soon and I hated working shift work. I became interested in Internet marketing, and that became my main obsession when I was 42ish. For those who are much younger, keep that in mind &#8211; you still have lots of TIME! Don&#8217;t quit &#8211; keep going.</p>
<h3><strong>How many times have you changed jobs (and what kind of jobs were those)?</strong></h3>
<p>Oh God &#8211; In music is was all over the place. Got fired from bands, fired from a music store jobs, and such (marijuana and drink were &#8220;issues&#8221;). I had countless restaurant jobs, and in aviation I worked for 7 different companies and/or airlines.</p>
<h3><strong>How did you end up in your current job position?</strong></h3>
<p>I finally realized that I was meant to be self-employed. I had to be free to fail or succeed on my own terms. I quit my job at the airlines when I was in Calgary, and went full time into Internet marketing. My wife and I have been working out of home ever since &#8211; HUGE ups and downs for income, but we paid off our house a few years ago. We&#8217;re in the valley again since Google changed their algo &#8220;bigly&#8221; in early 2017.</p>
<p>But the adventure continues! Still, love typing and being creative &#8211; it&#8217;s still SO MUCH FUN.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-896" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/digital-marketing-1024x683.jpg" alt="digital marketing" width="640" height="427"></p>
<h3><strong>What were your biggest challenge, failure, and success?</strong></h3>
<p>In my adult life, my biggest challenge was substance abuse and an unrealistic vision of success in the music business. In childhood, my biggest challenge was deformed hips and legs that caused a lot of self-confidence issues (bullies suck).</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge in Internet marketing has been search engine ranking changes. We&#8217;ve had to start over 4 times now. It gets harder every time, but if you keep creating content you&#8217;ll eventually succeed.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Finances</h2>
<h3><strong>What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</strong></h3>
<p>My wife doesn&#8217;t have any debt now. Our house is worth around $550,000, our Toyota Highlander is paid off, we have $350,000 in retirement savings. Our goal is to keep our Internet income high enough to keep saving and easily pay our monthly bills.</p>
<p>More will be revealed!</p>
<h3><strong>Tell us about your journey so far?</strong></h3>
<p>Think I did that above &#8211; it&#8217;s been a wild ride for sure. From living in rundown dumps, lurking in dirty bars, flying around the world with the airlines, and spending so many years stoned out of my mind &#8211; if I drop dead tomorrow, I won&#8217;t feel jipped. I feel very fortunate. My second wife Betty and I are very happy (hardly ever fight), no more music obsessions, no drug and alcohol abuse, and our kids are financially secure as well.</p>
<h3><strong>How did your profession affect your finances (directly, indirectly)?</strong></h3>
<p>My finances were affected BADLY until I was in my early forties. I spent money on anything I wanted at the time, racked up debt, and didn&#8217;t care. My goals had nothing to do with financial solvency.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Opinions</h2>
<h3><strong>Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</strong></h3>
<p>Never! If I could go back in time again I would dive head first into coding. The possibilities are endless, and it&#8217;s artistic in nature. I&#8217;m actually not a great coder with a ground-up understanding of all elements. I only write code when I need a specific function on a website. That&#8217;s why I primarily use PHP, Javascript, and HTML.</p>
<h3><strong>Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</strong></h3>
<p>That&#8217;s a tough one. I can&#8217;t recommend anything to others because we all have different needs and desires. I would say this though: IF you like working on your own and you&#8217;re a natural introvert, it may work for you. If you love writing and you&#8217;re not afraid of the basic technologies (like blog platforms) I would go for it.</p>
<p>Creating content is an extremely artistic craft, so if love being creative, it might be for you.</p>
<h3><strong>Tips for beginners?</strong></h3>
<p>If you love writing and creating, stick with it. You can make it. BUT, if you want to make a lot of money you need to have some websites that are purely for profit. Make sure to pursue traffic that PAYS BIG &#8211; examples would be the Insurance, Financial, and Legal niches. You want to make as much money per CPA that you can. You want to find affiliate associations, they pay between $10-$30 whenever the visitor fills out a simple 4 field form. (examples would be <a href="https://www.curadebt.com/">CureADebt</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/">ShareASale</a>)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Goals</h2>
<p>You have a few irons in the fire. You are a musician, a writer, a blogger, an internet marketer, a coder, and who knows what else <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Would you share your goals for these projects with us? &#8211; My main goal is to promote my book, keep blogging, and working with the <a href="https://wefindlenders.com/">WFL Project out of Rancho Mirage</a>. They pay me well for coding and blogging. I&#8217;m also learning about their niche. I still a have few dozen websites that make affiliate commissions and Adsense income &#8211; enough to pay our bills + some.</p>
<h3><strong>What are your financial goals for the short and the long term?</strong></h3>
<p>Short term goals make enough online to stay out of the brute workforce, and long-term to travel a lot with my family.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Preferences</h2>
<p><strong>We coders have our eternal debates, let us know which side do you stand?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Favorite&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Desktop OS = Windows</p>
<p>Mobile OS = Apple/Mac</p>
<p>Machine = Dell</p>
<p>Browser = Chrome, and Firefox</p>
<p>Programming language = PHP and Javascript</p>
<p>And the most important&#8230; spaces or tabs? = Lean towards <em>Tabs</em>, but as long as it&#8217;s consistent.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Coding exercise</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Would you write a couple of lines of code to present a simple financial principle?</p>
<pre style="text-align: left;"><strong>$php_coding = "consistent cash";</strong>

<strong>echo ("Give me" . " " . $php_coding . "!");</strong></pre>
<p>Good luck all, and remember&#8230;.we are not our egos or our minds. ;- )</p>
