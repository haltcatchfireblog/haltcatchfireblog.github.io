										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To be totally honest I wasn&#8217;t sure if this day will come. But it did, so I can peacefully write it down:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am six months into blogging.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe it seems like not a big deal to you, but it is huge for me. I am a recovering procrastinator and a serial quitter. Back in last September when I published <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/escaping-the-matrix/">my first post</a>&nbsp;with trembling hands I was a total noob. Wrote a mini CMS before, just for fun (and for some side money) but never spent more than 5 minutes in WordPress. Never used social media accounts. And last but not least I have never published anything online, especially not in English.</p>
<p>Now, six months later, I am confident with using WordPress, configuring plugins, messing around with domain names, hosting settings and even with <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/memes-reloaded/">the source code</a>. As an IT guy, this shouldn&#8217;t be a big surprise, actually, it would be a shame if I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>What is even a bigger achievement for me, is that I get along with Twitter, my first and only social media account. Maybe I dare say I like it. The rest of the social media platforms are still &#8220;terra incognita&#8221; for me and I am ok with this situation for now.</p>
<p>Still, the biggest win for me is that I managed to write some articles which entertained, educated or forced people to think about the topic. And most importantly in a way that they understood what I wanted to say. For a not native speaker, like me, this was a big challenge and a great exercise. (Fun fact: wrote roughly 30k words)</p>
<p>When I see this kind of reports from other bloggers they always publish some numbers. I did too when I was three months into this gig and <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/">struggled with doubts</a>. So let&#8217;s see the progress. Also, summarize the wins and fails.</p>
<h2>Numbers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Published posts: 37 (14 of them in the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/funny-friday/">Funny Friday series</a>, 5 of them in the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/memes/">Memes</a>&nbsp;section)</li>
<li>All time views: 3785 (by 2416 visitors)</li>
<li>Email subscribers: 3 (+1 in the last three months, woot-woot)</li>
<li>Followers: 7(+2) via WordPress, 286(+94) via Twitter</li>
<li>Most popular post:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/pirates-of-the-cryptobbean/">Pirates of the Cryptobbean</a></li>
<li>Best views ever: March 6th, 877 views from 720 visitors on a single day</li>
<li>Best referrers: <a href="http://rockstarfinance.com/">RockstarFinance</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://thefinancialdiet.com/">TheFinancialDiet</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep blogging for at least a year &#8211; six months check, so good so far</li>
<li>Established and consolidated connections and friendships in the community</li>
<li>Started an interview series (<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/coders-of-finance/">Coders of Finance</a>)</li>
<li>My first crypto post, <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/pirates-of-the-cryptobbean/">Pirates of the Cryptobbean</a>&nbsp;got selected and featured on <a href="https://rockstarfinance.com/pirates-of-the-cryptobbean/">RockStarFinance</a>&nbsp;(a big THANKS to <a href="http://lifezemplified.com/">Amy</a> and <a href="https://esimoney.com">ESI</a>) &#8211; This was the biggest win of this six months, one which I didn&#8217;t dare dream about!</li>
<li>When I mentioned one of my articles(my personal favorite, <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/memento-mori/">Memento Mori</a>) in a comment to <a href="http://jmoney.biz/">J$</a>(one of my blogger role models) over at <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/why-im-obsessed-with-cemeteries/">BudgetsAreSexy</a>&nbsp;he was able to recall it and quote the last sentences. It was a proud moment <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-707" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/crypto_skull.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401"></p>
<h2>Fails</h2>
<p>The only thing I regret is that I did not create enough new content. I had some personal barriers, but still, this is not a good excuse. The struggle of finding the time to write is still there, but I have to be honest with myself, I was not able to sacrifice family time for blogging. Not sure where that leaves me, but while blogging is a helluva fun cannot beat playing with my kids, reading bedtime stories and watching them fall asleep. I would sacrifice becoming the most successful blogger at any given time for being just a moderately awesome dad.</p>
<h2>Plans</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creating more useful content and publishing more articles is a huge goal for me, but I can promise that I will not hit the publish button just to publish something. Not a single time. That is over.</li>
<li>Continue searching for my voice/tribe/niche and as part of this, I want the blog to get more techie. I have plans on writing a few blogging tutorials about my experiences and going on with the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/coders-of-finance/">Coders of Finance</a> interview series and publish one every second week.</li>
<li>Start making memes again, there was a hiatus lately.</li>
<li>Keep it simple, keep it real <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s it for today, let&#8217;s review the things above in three months.</p>
<p>Thank you all for the encouragement and the kind words! You are awesome!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I was talking(whining) about my <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/">blogging struggles</a>, so there come the solutions. Also, thank you for the encouragement I received, good to know that I am not alone with schedule problems. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>Posting schedule</h2>
<p>My posting frequency so far was two posts per week, one content-based and one meme based. I like to work on both, but the way I was doing it is very inefficient. Living from post to post and write and publish in last minute is not the desired path. I am far from being satisfied with the quality of some of my posts and the best description I can give to them is funny/entertaining (well, most of the times :)). I want to shoot for writing quality content (Rockstar Quality maybe?), using more time, more research and going more in depth.</p>
<p>We are always told that post often and post consistently. That is how great success will come. While this is definitely true it seems that this is not the only way. As it turned out the urge to meet this recommendation did nothing good for my content and pushed me into the struggle. Then I remembered the <a href="https://doyouevenblog.com/podcast/1/">first podcast episode</a> I heard from <a href="https://twitter.com/doyouevenblog">Pete McPherson</a> over at <a href="https://doyouevenblog.com/">DoYouEvenBlog.com</a> which he recorded with our fellow financial blogger <a href="https://www.physicianonfire.com/">PhysicianOnFire</a>. At some point, he was talking about that it is a shame that a lot of newbies quit very soon and asked the question why don&#8217;t they reduce posting frequency instead to experiment what works for them and what does not. Pete gives some more tips <a href="https://doyouevenblog.com/blog-post-schedule/">here</a>, definitely worth reading.</p>
<p>This is exactly what I will do. Starting with January I will post only one or two posts per month. I hope that this will help to allocate more time for working on my articles which will be able to provide more value to my readers. Same time it will force me to focus more on the topics. In the past I was picking them randomly, however, I had a long list of potential titles before started blogging. I will combine them with my newer list and choose the most interesting dozen of them. Also, I can not promise that there will not be any random post, like the last (and only, so far) <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/tuesday-rant-six-figure-problem/">rant</a>(?).</p>
<h2><img class="wp-image-609 aligncenter" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/notebook-428293_640-300x198.jpg" alt="Notebook" width="400" height="264"></h2>
<h2>Filling blank spaces</h2>
<p>Following the path I described above I still afraid that the lack of weekly fresh stuff will make my tiny reader base abandon the site, so I knew that I have to find out something. Taking into account this fact and combining it with my personal interests I came to the solution that I will fill the void with series and guest posts.</p>
<h3>Series</h3>
<p>For a while, I was thinking about this and came up with two ideas. The first one is purely fueled by personal interests and I have already reached out to two fellow bloggers who accepted my participation request and have some more on my list to reach out. This will be called <strong>&#8220;Coders of FInance&#8221;</strong> and as you probably guessed, I will interview programmers and IT professionals about their lives, jobs, and their FI journey.</p>
<p>The second topic is much more tricky, I feel that it will be a challenge to find participants. The series can be called <strong>&#8220;World on FIRE&#8221;</strong>, but this is not carved in stone. We get a huge amount of information about FIRE strategies and most of them are very US specific. The fact that I am a non-US dweller myself and that I bet a lot of other members of our community has a healthy amount of financial voyeurism gave me the idea of starting a post series about FIRE strategies, vehicles, possibilities in other countries.</p>
<h3>Guest posts</h3>
<p>This is probably not a big surprise, everybody does it. I have already collected 5-6 titles which I find very promising, will see if someone would be interested in writing about them. Don&#8217;t want to share them at this point, but trust me these will be special <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Hey, you forgot about Funny Friday</h3>
<p>I have a confession. I am a meme addict. Same time I am not that dumb to stop making these which brought probably some of you alone to my site. But that series in its current state is not the best possible way, so be prepared, this week I will do a &#8220;Best Of&#8221; compilation and then I will shut it down. But don&#8217;t be afraid, my financial memes will come back next year in a new form, I have something in mind, just have to find out in the holidays how should I achieve that.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-611" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/darts-102919_640-300x200.jpg" alt="Darts" width="400" height="266"></p>
<h2>Goals for 2018</h2>
<p>So just to summarize and finish off this year here are my blogging goals for the next year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay in blogging and make posting work</li>
<li>Start the aforementioned series</li>
<li>Bring fun into the FIRE community through memes</li>
<li>Receive my first guest post invitation (without asking)</li>
<li>See one of my articles end up featured on Rockstar Finance</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ok, that&#8217;s all folks. I will spend the holidays focusing on quality family time and working under the hood in my very limited free time so stay tuned for the Funny Friday &#8211; Best Of Edition this Friday as that will be my last post this year.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week the long-awaited or long-hated (depends on your perspective) Thanksgiving and Black Friday will come. As I reported <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/funny-friday-black-friday-edition/">last week</a> it’s over at our ends, they held it last weekend for some reason. This is not an event which I fanatically wait all year long, just another sales date when I check if only there is something on sale which I had plans on buying for a while. I did not want to waste any more words on the topic, but meanwhile, some thoughts formulated in my mind which I wanted to share.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-482 size-full" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Thanksgiving-Turkey-Meme-1.jpg" alt="Thanksgiving Turkey" width="620" height="431"></p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t ruin Thanksgiving</h2>
<p>J$ at BudgetsAreSexy wrote an interesting article with the title&nbsp;<a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/are-you-financially-average/">Are You Financially Average?</a>. At the end there is an interesting statistic about some people&#8217;s plans.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>22% of Americans plan to begin their Black Friday shopping online after Thanksgiving dinner</li>
<li>11% of Americans admit to shopping on their mobile phones during Thanksgiving dinner</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While I consider the first fact slightly acceptable, the second one totally makes me crazy. Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you humans?&nbsp;In an optimal situation there is delicious food and good company gathered together to express their gratitude. Enjoy it when you can, damn it. It is not the proper time for hunting bargains under the table.</p>
<p>A couple of times I had encounters with mobile tappers at the table on family gatherings and it turned out pretty quickly, that I have a serious allergy from that phenomenon. My blood pressure rises and I feel an instant urge to throw their phones out of the window. Unfortunately, I cannot do this with other people’s kids and mobiles not bought by me, but I always pledge that I will do so if my children will behave like that.</p>
<p><em>Note for future me: buy only cheap phones for the kids!</em></p>
<h2>Don’t risk your life</h2>
<p>It is unbelievable to me that every year humans die/get injured because of shopping. I can imagine a thousand scenarios when risking your life would be an option but grabbing a toaster for 99% less than it’s normal price is not on the list (not even close). According to the news (I don’t have any personal experience so I have to relate them), in some cases, they even use physical power or pepper spray against each other. Again, what the fuck is wrong with you? So please, if getting a new (insert any product here) is not a life-or-death situation please stay at home and do something more fulfilling. If the urge is serious, attack online shops instead.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-485" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thanksgiving_black_friday_not_sure.jpg" alt="Not sure if Black Friday or Hunger Games" width="552" height="414"></p>
<h2>Don’t buy just anything</h2>
<p>I assume you are all rational, intentional, frugal human beings out there, thus I am preaching to the choir, but still I have to emphasize this. The fact that you can buy something for the fraction of its real price does not mean that you need it. Everybody likes (loves?) saving money and getting great deals. But that is a deal/saving only if you need that thing. Otherwise it’s just wasting your time and money.</p>
<p><em>My two tips on this topic:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>buy only products on sale which you would buy for the original price too</em></li>
<li><em>make a list of items you really need (use watchlists or whatever) and only check those</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These were just my two cents. Happy celebrations for everyone. And please take care!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Today a lot of people celebrate Halloween all over the world. Nowadays my homeland is included, but that was not always the case. Let me introduce you my relationship with Halloween.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">The origins</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">I hope you know the origins of this celebration (if not, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween">Wikipedia</a> is your friend), and you can see farther from the commercially boosted, candy sweating reality. It seems there are two “clubs” around here, who are for Halloween and who are against it. I have to admit that for a long time I belonged to the previous group and still kind of maneuvering between the two. To understand my revulsion let me put this into context.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was born into a communist country, same time into the Hungarian minority which has very strong roots in Christianity. Thus, while in the hardcore communist countries religion was persecuted, here was tolerated. This lets my people keep their folkways and this time of the year is an important part of it (more on this in next week&#8217;s post). We were not really aware of this event, all my childhood it was just another American thing which we have seen on television, like cowboys and fast cars.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">First encounters</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was later in my teenage years when these Halloween parties started to spread. The difference was that people were dancing and binge drinking in costumes instead of regular clothes (the slut costume was very popular as I recall). Call me conservative, but I found this only interesting and not something I really can relate to. It looked like party places (and stores selling costumes) just found another excuse to hold a party mid-week and take a healthy profit. Then later the “Trick-or-treat” part started to sneak into the minds of the younger population and conquered them rapidly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-385" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/who_killed_my_halloween_elsa.jpg" alt="who-killed-my-halloween-elsa" width="337" height="600"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Until that point, only the teenage/young adult age group was aware of the celebrations, but then suddenly everybody knew it. And the way it came was disgusting to me in many ways. Don’t get me wrong I am not against having fun, partying or dressing up. I took my share of all of these activities. What made me disgusted, and probably ruined this fun event for me forever, was the way it exploded into the public awareness. It was pervaded by commercialism and I felt that it was forced on us.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Suddenly it seemed that decorating your house, buying costumes, attending parties or trick-or-treating become mandatory. And of course, nobody knew why. They accepted all this commercial flood of shit without any question. The most critical ones started an offensive against this whole Halloween thing, saying that this is not our celebration, not our culture and they had a kind of “kill it with fire” attitude. At first, I had a sympathy with this approach then joined the “I don’t care” group.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">The turning point</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then I became a parent and had to face this date again last year when my daughter started kindergarten. They held a Halloween themed day with costumes, candy and parents were asked if they could provide some carved pumpkins. Let me tell you that when you see the excitement on your daughter’s face that she can dress up as a witch (hopefully I will never see the “B” version) puts the event into a different light. Suddenly I felt that I have to put things into place about this celebration to prevent myself from being rejective. So I made my research and surprisingly the new information reframed my thinking, took part in the preparations and in the end I was happy with the outcome.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I will not repeat all the historical things here about Samhain, its transformation, and other religious stuff, you can read it yourself if you want. But suddenly everything made sense and I came to an enlightenment. I do not hate Halloween. I hate its commercially ruined representation. It is the same when you ask a kid if he knows what is Christmas about and he replies that it is about getting presents instead of celebrating love. The materialistic sugar coating remains and the real meaning of the celebration becomes &#8220;lost in context&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-388" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/who_killed_my_halloween_jason.jpg" alt="who-killed-my-halloween-jason" width="520" height="347"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The feeling that you are forced to spend on a costume for your kid, decoration for your home, candy for other kids, etc… is annoying to me. It is more saddening when you hear stories about homes got covered in eggs and toilet paper where the residents were not giving away candies. I think that this can not be a legit expectation where people are not familiar/confident celebrating this event or worse if they cannot afford, which is not rare. This is pure cruelty and vandalism in my eyes.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">State of play</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since I had my aha-moment I don’t fight against Halloween anymore. I still don’t feel that I have to celebrate it, but I do not judge anyone who does. To be honest I bought some smaller accessories and was assisting while my wife was making my daughters costume. We had a great time carving pumpkins together, which grew in our garden. And bought some candy to complement our supplies. In the end, I had come to the conclusion that if you take out the consumerism component it is a cool event. Just be sure that when the kids will be older you explain the background and the meaning of the happenings to them.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">As closing words let me give you my three frugality tips for Halloween which can make this event more enjoyable and less materialistic:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;">If you need costumes and/or decoration try to stick to the DIY approach. You can make good stuff from cheap or around the house materials. You can have fun in the process together instead of just picking a ready-made plastic-textile piece of shit transported from two continents away.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">This is not for everyone, but for the ones who have an at least 10sqft garden. You can grow your own pumpkins and a couple of plants can provide you with enough for the event. Pumpkins are very undemanding so not a big deal growing them. You can put the seeds away and use them for planting next year. Also, you can make delicious stuff from them so absolutely worth it.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">This will a cheap-ass sounding one, but I can handle the criticism, I think. Don’t know about you but my daughters keep receiving chocolates, candies, etc… all year long. And to be honest some of them are so artificial and sugar stuffed that I hide them away until they forget about them. This is a great opportunity to not just dump them but giving away. Good for the environment, good for your budget. Maybe not that good for the kids, but be sure you hand them to the naughty ones <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Happy Halloween for everyone!</strong></em></p>
