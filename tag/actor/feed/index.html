										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you probably noticed I am trying to get inspiration from actual events/reads for these <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/funny-friday/">Funny Friday</a> posts. As it turned out you get a lot of different stimulus across the week, so finding a pattern or a theme can be hard sometimes. Honestly, I am thinking hard on dumping the themed editions idea and just fall back to a weekly roundup version. Anyway, what I am sure about that this Funny Friday series will change somehow in the future, just did not get to a decision yet.</p>
<p>Lately read about the positive or negative financial habits of some famous actors, like <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/07/johnny-depp-financial-crisis-money">Johnny Depp</a>, <a href="https://www.thefrugalgene.com/lifestyle-inflation/">Nicolas Cage</a> and Woody Harrelson (will add the link when I find it, I promise). Then I thought I will have a look at their net worths which lead me to <a href="https://www.therichest.com/top-lists/top-100-richest-actors/">this list</a>. It was obvious that I will not create a proper financial meme from all of them, but I chose some of my favorites. I hope you will like them.</p>
<h2>#6 Mel Gibson &#8211; $425M</h2>
<p>He had a lot of great acts, but probably Braveheart was the most memorable. I tried to bring a little bit of actuality for his words though.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-433" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_mel_gibson.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Mel-Gibson" width="413" height="478"></p>
<h2>#8 Sylvester Stallone &#8211; $400M</h2>
<p>Most of the people adore his action movies (cannot blame them, he is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_(film_series)">Rambo</a> after all), others prefer the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_(film_series)">Rocky series</a>. Maybe I am a weirdo, but for me his best movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102603/">Oscar</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-434" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_sylvester_stallone.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Sylvester-Stallone" width="620" height="465"></p>
<h2>#10 Tom Hanks &#8211; $350M</h2>
<p>I devour nearly everything what has a touch from him both as an actor or as a director. I am very picky about war themed movies, but&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185906/">Band of Brothers</a>&nbsp;is definitely one of my favorites and I cannot tell a single film which I was not able to watch having him as an actor.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-431" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_tom_hanks.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Tom-Hanks" width="400" height="270"></p>
<h2>#18 Leonardo DiCaprio &#8211; $245M</h2>
<p>Despite I pigeonholed him after Titanic I have to admit that almost all his movies are great and some of them like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264464/">Catch Me If You Can</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130884/">Shutter Island</a> are epic. Probably another contrarian opinion, but I was not able to watch the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/">Wolf of Wall Street</a>, after a while is started to become a big crying over rich people&#8217;s first world problems.&nbsp;<a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/why-arent-you-stealing-from-the-government/">This post</a> was also an inspiration for this meme, thanks <a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/">Mr. Groovy.</a></p>

<h2>#26 Johnny Depp &#8211; $200M</h2>
<p>You can love him or hate him (or blame him for his questionable money habits) he is a legend and his acting is genious. Deal with it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-430" src="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_johnny_depp.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Johnny-Depp" width="620" height="413"></p>
<p><em>I plan to keep updating this post in the future to include as many actors as I can from the list. You may ask, why? Well, because I like great movies (who don&#8217;t?) and the research was great fun. So keep an eye on this <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Have a Funny Friday!</em></p>
