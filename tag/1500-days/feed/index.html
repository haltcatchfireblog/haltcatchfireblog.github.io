<p>I know, I know and you are right. I should have been waking up <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/wake-me-up-when-september-ends/">when September ends</a>. And now it is almost the end of October and all I published is a rant about <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/thanks-for-your-concern-suze-but-the-fire-movement-is-fine/">the Suze Orman phenomenon</a>. She <a href="https://earlyretirementdude.com/suze-orman-big-pivots-bad-publicity-always-seem-icky-said/">apparently “changed” her mind</a>, btw.</p>
<p>So what happened? Well, I try to stick with a new writing schedule and carve out 1-2 hours at least 2-3 evenings a week. Same time it seems I got more critical towards my writings, I accumulated four drafts so far but was not satisfied&nbsp;with (or did not finish) them. That&#8217;s why you have seen no posts. I felt that it would be better if I could publish one good article in a month than one crappier every week.</p>
<p>But don’t afraid, I was actually working on something in the last two weeks. Just not for my own blog. Carl, alias <a href="https://www.1500days.com/start-here/">Mr. 1500</a>, reloaded his <a href="https://www.1500days.com/10-questions/">10 questions series</a> a few months ago and kindly invited us, blogging noobies to participate. I jumped on the opportunity and did not want to phone it. I think I ended up with more than 20 answers and 3k words. I was tempted to answer them all but many of these would have been non-interesting one-liners so just skipped including those. Just in case you are curious about what would be my answer to any of them let me know in the comments section and I will fill the void.</p>
