Earlier this week I wrote about my relationship with Halloween and that finally, I accepted it. Then it passed by without a single sign. This year I have seen no decorations, except in a supermarket. No kids in costumes wandering the streets and no one rang our bell for trick-or-treating. I was surprised and still don‚Äôt know why.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&lt;offtopic&gt;This is not connecting to this Funny Friday episode, so you can skip it if you want. Earlier this week I wrote about my <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/who-killed-my-halloween/">relationship with Halloween</a> and that finally, I accepted it. Then it passed by without a single sign. This year I have seen no decorations, except in a supermarket. No kids in costumes wandering the streets and no one rang our bell for trick-or-treating. I was surprised and still don‚Äôt know why. Maybe never will.&lt;/offtopic&gt;</p>
<p>This week Sam over at Financial Samurai published a post with the title <a href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-stop-worrying-about-childs-future/">How To Stop Worrying About Your Child‚Äôs Future In This Competitive World</a>. I will not discuss the post in depth, go and read, worth the time. Also, I want to note that, despite the debate escalated about if he over-worries his son‚Äôs future, I agree with him in every detail. Maybe I am overstressing this topic too, but to be honest my whole journey into personal finance was kickstarted by the birth of my first daughter.</p>
<p>When I first held my daughter in my arms I realized that life will never be the same again and that now I have someone whom I will worry until the day I die. Four years later I have another one girl to worry about. And my mindset about stability and security changed entirely. This is a Funny Friday post, so I will not go into the details (keep them for a future post). Instead here are a handful of memes about the things popped into my mind about this topic. Don‚Äôt try to search for a storyline or any structure, this is an ‚Äúoff the top of my head‚Äù type of list.</p>
<h2>Negotiating</h2>
<p>Kids are extremely good in negotiating. Especially if it is about going to bed or eating another slice of chocolate. We should embrace this skill in them instead of suppressing it. What if they would be aware of their financial situation?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-408" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_negotiating.jpg" alt="Funny-Fiday-7-Negotiation" width="750" height="500"></p>
<h2>Practice what you preach</h2>
<p>Like it or not, we are role models to them at least in the early years. Don‚Äôt let the lack of interest or attention they keep an eye on your every single move and record everything. Knowing this it is extremely important to practice what you preach.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-407" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_loan.jpg" alt="Practice what you preach - Loan" width="500" height="902"></p>

<h2>Finances</h2>
<p>You will be responsible for teaching the basic concepts of life, relationships, and finances to them properly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-405" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_concepts.jpg" alt="Basic concepts - FIRE" width="468" height="615"></p>
<h2>Careers</h2>
<p>While you should not force them to choose a career path you prefer, you should totally give them advice and try to protect them from stepping on the wrong path.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-406" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_career.jpg" alt="Career choice" width="494" height="688"></p>
<h2>Family business</h2>
<p>Creating a family business, teaching them valuable lessons and then when the time comes passing down the keys to them is an absolutely good thing in my opinion. My father is working in the family business which was started by my grandfather (imagine nothing fancy, there are two workers, he and my grandma). After working for others for 20+ years and got laid down in a very inappropriate way, this was the thing which made him able to provide a living for his family.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-401" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_7_takeover.jpg" alt="Family Business Takeover" width="526" height="394"></p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Taking the compound interest into account even this blog could develop into a valuable asset which I could leave as an inheritance to my children (or grandchildren). How cool would it be to hand down the site to them?</p>
