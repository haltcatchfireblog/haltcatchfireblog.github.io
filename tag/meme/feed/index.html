										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all, I want to wish a success packed very Happy New Year. I wasn&#8217;t too active in the recent holiday season and spent the last month getting back on track. As I stated in earlier I want to turn 2018 into a more techie year, thus I spent the last couple of days with geeking around with WordPress. The goal was to give memes a new way of appearance as I sent the <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/funny-friday/">Funny Friday</a> series into early retirement.</p>
<p>I have to confess something. Before I started my blog and started using WordPress I was a hater. Back in the days when I entered web development, I was taught that it is evil. It is just a big pile of crappy spaghetti code and if you use it bad boys will hack your site and steal your data (maybe even your soul). I was a newbie and they were the seniors, so I accepted what they said and went on hating WordPress without any further investigation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-671" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/i_hated_wordpress.jpg" alt="I hated WordPress" width="460" height="480"></p>
<p>It is true that in those times these statements were partly valid. Those early versions were not so sophisticated and there were much more poorly coded third-party plugins and themes. These caused serious security problems in some cases. Still, I regret that I did not start&nbsp;examining the codebase and experimenting with template and plugin development earlier. I could be a WP Wizard these days.</p>
<p>Years went by. When I started to learn about blogging and realized that almost 30% (crazy!) percent of the&nbsp;websites on the internet is running on this platform this regret became even worse. Since I started this blog, I really wanted to dig a little bit into the topic and get my hands dirty. Unfortunately, while I was chasing my own deadlines I was not able to do so. Finally, the rethinking of the Funny Friday meme series brought the need for opening the hood and add tiny bits of code. As it turned out WP has a very handy develop documentation.</p>
<p>If you are not interested in a little bit of coding and you are satisfied with the functionality the codebase and the UI can provide, please, don&#8217;t read further. Just be delighted that the brand new MEMES sections became accessible from the top menu. Every time the muse visits me and I make a meme I will post it there. There will be new ones every sometimes <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h1>The tweak</h1>
<p>You may ask why did I have to tweak my WP setup to make this possible. Well, maybe it is just my personal preference, but I wanted the memes listing page to work a little bit differently. First of all, created a separate category called &#8220;Memes&#8221;, created a separate menu item for its listing page and added the first post,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/dont-save-like-dory/">Dory</a>&nbsp;as my guinea pig (ok, maybe this is confusing). The post format was set to &#8220;Image&#8221;, well&#8230; because memes will be single/multi-image posts. The first thing I faced that this case Dory will jump to my main landing page as it will become the latest post.</p>
<h2>Homepage exclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Maybe not a big deal, but as these posts will not have a featured image and it seems the excerpt, which shows up by default will not display the one and only image, the whole item looks odd. so I decided that the posts from this category should be excluded from the main listing page. A short search told me this is not something WP supports by default. There is a plugin for that (as for many other things), but I felt it an overkill for such a simple task. Same time, the fewer plugins you use the lower the overall complexity will be and because of this, I try to use as few plugins as possible. Further investigations lead me to the solution to supplement the theme&#8217;s functions. You can enter into theme file editor through Appearance menu&#8217;s Editor option. Then on the right side, you can find (probably, not true for all versions and all themes) Theme Functions (functions.php). You can exclude one or more categories from the main listing page adding the following lines to the end of the file.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<pre>function exclude_category( $query ) {
    if ( $query-&gt;is_home() &amp;&amp; $query-&gt;is_main_query() ) {
        $query-&gt;set( 'cat', '-33' );
    }
}
add_action( 'pre_get_posts', 'exclude_category' );</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You may ask &#8220;what the heck is happening here?&#8221;. Well, we declare a function called <strong><em>exclude_category</em></strong> which performs a check if the current query is the query for the blog homepage and if it is the main query. If both statements evaluate to true, then we exclude the memes category from the query. The only information you need is the category ID which you can find out from the URL when you are editing it (&#8230;&amp;tag_ID=33&#8230; in my case). The minus sign before the category ID indicates that this is an exclusion. When WordPress is rendering our page after creating the query object, but before running it calls the hook called&nbsp;<strong><em>pre_get_posts&nbsp;</em></strong>which calls our function. The exclusion takes effect and from now on the posts from the <em>memes&nbsp;</em>category will not show up on the homepage.</p>
<h2>Custom memes category page</h2>
<p>Now when I checked the <em>Memes</em>&nbsp;listing page and what I saw is that the posts are still not showing up properly. It turned out that the theme uses the same setting for the category pages as the homepage to determine if it should show the whole posts or just the excerpts in the list. Because of the aforementioned reasons, we have to do something with this too. A little bit of research revealed that on rendering a category page, it looks for templates in the following order: <em>category-slug.php → category-id.php → category.php → archive.php → index.php</em>. In my theme, the <em>archive.php</em> template is the one which was responsible for rendering the Memes category page, so the only thing I had to do is to make a copy of it, rename it to <em>category-memes.php</em>&nbsp;and make some changes.</p>
<p>The original archives.php look like:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php
/**
 * The template for displaying archive pages.
 *
 *
 *
 * @package Nisarg
 */
get_header(); ?&gt;
	&lt;div class="container"&gt;
		&lt;div class="row"&gt;
			&lt;?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?&gt;
				&lt;header class="archive-page-header"&gt;
					&lt;?php
						the_archive_title( '&lt;h3 class="archive-page-title"&gt;'.__( 'Browsed by', 'nisarg' ).'&lt;br&gt;', '&lt;/h3&gt;' );
						the_archive_description( '&lt;div class="taxonomy-description"&gt;', '&lt;/div&gt;' )
					?&gt;
				&lt;/header&gt;&lt;!-- .page-header --&gt;
				&lt;div id="primary" class="col-md-9 content-area"&gt;
					&lt;main id="main" class="site-main" role="main"&gt;
					&lt;?php /* Start the Loop */
					while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
						/*
						 * If you want to disaplay only excerpt, file content-excerpt.php will be used.
						 * Include the Post-Format-specific template for the content.
						 * If you want to override this in a child theme, then include a file
						 * called content-___.php (where ___ is the Post Format name) and that will be used instead.
						 */
						$post_display_option = get_theme_mod( 'post_display_option', 'post-excerpt' );

						if ( 'post-excerpt' === $post_display_option ) {
							get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', 'excerpt' );
						} else {
							get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', get_post_format() );
						}
					endwhile;
					nisarg_posts_navigation(); ?&gt;
			&lt;?php else : ?&gt;
				&lt;?php get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', 'none' ); ?&gt;
			&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
				&lt;/main&gt;&lt;!-- #main --&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #primary --&gt;
			&lt;?php get_sidebar( 'sidebar-1' ); ?&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--.row--&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--.container--&gt;
&lt;?php get_footer(); ?&gt;</pre>
<p>After some decluttering the result is:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php
/**
 * The template for displaying memes category pages.
 *
 *
 *
 * @package Nisarg
 */
get_header(); ?&gt;
	&lt;div class="container"&gt;
		&lt;div class="row"&gt;
			&lt;?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?&gt;
				&lt;div id="primary" class="col-md-9 content-area"&gt;
					&lt;main id="main" class="site-main" role="main"&gt;
					&lt;?php /* Start the Loop */
					while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
						get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', get_post_format() );
					endwhile;
					nisarg_posts_navigation(); ?&gt;
			&lt;?php else : ?&gt;
				&lt;?php get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', 'none' ); ?&gt;
			&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
				&lt;/main&gt;&lt;!-- #main --&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #primary --&gt;
			&lt;?php get_sidebar( 'sidebar-1' ); ?&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--.row--&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--.container--&gt;
&lt;?php get_footer(); ?&gt;</pre>
<p>As you may see I have removed the unnecessary &#8220;Browsed by&#8221; part and removed the excerpt possibility.</p>
<p>So good so far. There is a separate menu point for the &#8220;Memes&#8221;, the posts do not show up on the homepage and their category page displays them properly.</p>
<p>There is only one thing remaining. <a href="https://jetpack.com/">Jetpack</a> does good work in the comments section, auto-sharing on twitter and sending notification emails on new posts. However, when published Dory I realized that maybe my readers would not want to be notified by each and every new meme.</p>
<h2>Exclusion from the notifications</h2>
<p>Searching for such an option proved ineffectual so I turned again to good ol&#8217; Google. Shortly after I added this couple of lines of code to the end of my <em>functions.php.</em></p>
<pre>add_filter( 'jetpack_subscriptions_exclude_these_categories', 'exclude_these' );
function exclude_these( $categories ) {
	$categories = array( 'memes' );
	return $categories;
}</pre>
<p>I won&#8217;t waste many words on this, the code is self-explanatory and does the trick.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all. Not a big deal from a technical perspective but it was fun. Depending on your technical savviness the things in this post can range from &#8220;black magic&#8221; to &#8220;piece of cake&#8221;. Whichever is the case thanks for reading and please share your thoughts with me in the comments about WordPress. Oh, and please let me know if I should go on this geeky road further or get back to the stories of the good ol&#8217; days (I have both on my list).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey All, yes it seems I am still here. To be honest, I was not sure about continuing this Funny Friday series, however, these were the most popular here. It is a little bit hard to compose a whole set of memes and find a topic as most of the time inspiration comes randomly and for a single meme. This will highly impact the future of these series but will tell more about that next week.</p>
<p>This week the situation was the same when I was reading&nbsp;<a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/how-do-you-hide-your-wealth/">How Are You Stealthy With Your Wealthy?</a>&nbsp;form J$. I noted that his post could fill a Funny Friday episode and he&nbsp;gave &#8220;full permission to do so&#8221;. I really liked the article, hiding your wealth is really boosting it under the hood. In the post, there were five bullet points which I want to present here with a meme each, just in reverse&nbsp;order (you will see in the end the reason :)).</p>
<h2>#5. I eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches 4 days a week</h2>
<p>I have no idea about this thing, but many people worship it so it has to be the food of the gods.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-595" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_pbj.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500"></p>
<h2>#4. I live in a 1,100 sq ft place which is literally the smallest house on the block</h2>
<p>This surprised me as this seems a reliable size to me, we are living in a roughly similar sized house. Also, the $2200 monthly rent blew my mind, you could rent a house for a year here (if you find one to let).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-594" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_house.jpg" alt="" width="616" height="462"></p>
<h2>#3. I’ve become a pretty good minimalist</h2>
<p>This is a trick I am using myself, our laptops are the most expensive things in the house. I have a friend and when we were at his place his father told us &#8220;always be sure to lock the doors, otherwise someone could bring in something&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-593" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_santa.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="450"></p>
<h2>#2. My clothes are riddled with holes</h2>
<p>I am guilty of this too, however, my wife always has an eye on my clothes while doing the laundry. This means that every now and then some hole riddled piece miraculously&nbsp;get lost. Needless to say not my relique clothes which are the only leftovers of my teenage years. Dumping my band name (not brand name) hoodies would be a straight case of divorce.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-592" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_holes.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="356"></p>
<h2>#1. I rock a mohawk</h2>
<p>This point needs no comment. Honestly, I think everybody deserves to have a mohawk at least once in a lifetime. It would change the perspective of the whole world, trust me or just ask Jim from <a href="https://www.routetoretire.com/first-24-hours-j-money-mohawk/">Route To Retire</a>&nbsp;who was brave enough to try it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-591" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_13_mohawk.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="697"></p>
<p><em>Note: it blew my mind when I found this image. Is it just for me or the similarity is strong with this? I imagine J$ like that when he will be appr. 76 years old and picking the brains of youngsters who question his financial skills because of his hear cut.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s&nbsp;it for now, share with me in the comments if you liked this series. And stay tuned, I will have news about the future next week. Have a Funny Friday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I published my first <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/tuesday-rant-six-figure-problem/">rant post</a> and it became one of the most viewed posts in no time. Of course, I faced some arguments, but fortunately from the good kind.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-564" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_12_most-interesting_man.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Most Interesting Man" width="500" height="627"></p>
<p>While I can accept their points I still stick to my opinion but tried not to be rude.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-563" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_12_not_sure.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Not Sure" width="552" height="414"></p>
<p>Maybe that is because I have seen too many people complaining while their actions didn&#8217;t show any real endeavor to change their situation. The following example is based on true story. If you take smoking into account only as any other luxury habit which eats up 20% of your family budget then, in my opinion, it is a space for cutting back.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-562" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_12_willy_wonka.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Willy Wonka" width="504" height="500"></p>
<p>I have to admit that I am not less guilty living in a modern(?) country than any one of you, but people should really have to learn to live within their means and avoid developing those so-called first world problems.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-561" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_12_first_world_problem.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - First World Problems" width="552" height="367"></p>
<p>A lesson I learned as a coder which is very helpful in any field sounds like the saying &#8220;where there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way&#8221;. If you are not happy with your situation you should research your opportunities instead of just complaining about it and blame it on others.</p>

<p>After all, that is why we are lurking here in this corner of the internet, to learn about earning, saving, investing and avoiding money failures <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2>+1</h2>
<p>This is an unrelated rant about a recent event I read about. This is a message to companies which are going too far.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you walk in the day of light these days it is inevitable to hear someone talking about <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/the-best-investment-advice/">investing</a> or mining Bitcoins. These mysterious things called cryptocurrencies are around for while, but only recently got into the spotlight that much that next time when you will visit your grandma she will probably asking you about them too. This popularity caused by a recent huge appreciation of Bitcoin, which caused this modern investing fever we have not seen since the 19th century gold rush.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-520" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_ask.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Afraid To Ask" width="490" height="480"></p>
<p>I will not go into details about what Bitcoin is, if you want to know more about this digitally revolutionary thing, then please check this free video course by <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking/bitcoin/v/bitcoin-what-is-it">Khan Academy</a>. It provides a lot of interesting information about the whole topic, but I think you did not come here for teachings on a Funny Friday, did you?</p>
<p>Then what will be the memes about then? Well, I took my thoughts and opinions on the topic and mixed up with some interesting facts randomly.</p>
<h2>Satoshi Nakamoto</h2>
<p>The person or the group who released the concept are hiding behind the aforementioned name. The real identity of the creator is unknown, however, there are some theories about it. One of them is that this name is a simple mixture of the names of the four tech giants SAmsung, TOSHIba, NAKAmichi and MOTOrola. My only problem with this approach is that if these four giant companies unite forces to create such a thing there is no chance that they would ever be able to keep it in secret. My favorite version is that in the real world the cryptographer, Nick Szabo is the real Satoshi. I have to admit that I am biased on this because he is a fellow Hungarian <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> but he is a real expert on the topic, even Tim Ferris recorded a podcast with him with the title <a href="https://tim.blog/2017/06/04/nick-szabo/">“The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency”</a>. He denies the statement, but I cannot blame him. I would do the same if I had approximately 1 million Bitcoins which worths ten billion dollars at current value.</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-524" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_nick_szabo.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Yoda" width="475" height="547"></h2>
<h2>Bitcoin Investing</h2>
<p>In the recent years, but especially in this year a hundreds of posts were published on the topic of Bitcoin investing. However it sounds legit for the everyday people the proud members of our community knows exactly that this is pure speculation. Of course despite this fact it can be very profitable as the change in the price of one BTC from the beginnings exceeds 200.000%. Not a bad ROI, huh?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-521" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_roi.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Shut Up" width="500" height="281"></p>
<h2>The Most Expensive Pizza Ever</h2>
<p>The first documented purchase of a good with Bitcoin was made by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Laszlo_Hanyecz">Laszlo Hanyecz</a>. He bought two Domino&#8217;s pizzas for the astonishing amount of 10.000 BTC on May 17, 2010. On todays value it would be almost $10M, hope the restaurant was wise enough to keep them. To commemorate the transaction, May 22 became the&nbsp;Bitcoin Pizza Day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-522" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_pizza.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Bad Luck Brian" width="475" height="562"></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mining</h2>
<p>Bitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger. Anyone with internet connection and proper hardware can participate, but there are giant corporations who are dominating the crypto mining world. There are huge factory buildings in China stuffed with computer parts, running all the time and make their owners wealthier and wealthier every single minute.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-525" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_mine.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="666"></p>
<h2>What Is The Future</h2>
<p>As they say &#8220;No one can predict the future&#8221;. Some say this crypto thing is just another bubble which will burst soon. Others are fanatically putting all their money into it. Who will be right in the end? Who knows. The opponents say that these &#8220;coins&#8221; has no intrinsic value. The advocates say that it has the same attributes as real gold and it will bring the digital revolution to our world. Personally, I think that both sides are right. In terms of profitability and price appreciation I think the hype is strong with this one and sooner or later the bubble will burst. On the other hand, the technology, especially the newer improved variations, like Ethereum and many others are very promising and I believe that it will bring some kind of tech revolution.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-528" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny_friday_11_not_sure.jpg" alt="Funny Friday - Not Sure" width="552" height="414"></p>
<p><em>What do you think about the topic? Do you have BTC &#8220;investments&#8221;? Do you think it&#8217;s a bubble? Please share your thoughts with me in the comments!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago I noticed on twitter that people started to talk about buying meat and making sauce and holiday spending (yes I am talking about you J$ and Justin). At first, I got confused because there is a couple of weeks left until Christmas shopping kicks in. The from other comments I realized that I am an idiot, there will come be Thanksgiving and Black Friday soon in the US.</p>
<p>Similarly to <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/who-killed-my-halloween/">Halloween</a>, this is not a holiday we celebrate here in my homeland. Of course, I know from my childhood television consumption that it has to do something with settlers, indians and turkeys. To my excuse, this happening was presented to me by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VbYZDohsHk">Wednesday Addams</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-458" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_wednesday.gif" alt="Funny-Friday-Wednesday" width="500" height="250"></p>
<p>A couple of years ago the commercial infection brought us the Black Friday too (totally unrelated to the above). While in Serbia we cannot talk about an epidemic , the spread in Hungary is more severe. Just for some strange reason, they hold it a week earlier so it happens today. On this occasion, I dug the net (and my head) for some meme ideas. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Can not think of a better kickstart for any topic than the good old Ned.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-469" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_ned_stark.jpg" alt="" width="622" height="477"></p>
<p>On the quest of taking advantage of the Black Friday discount, this was me today.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-468" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_bad_luck_brian.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="562"></p>
<p>Then I came to this conclusion. (Yes, Ned again… I mean Boromir… whatever)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-467" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_boromir.jpg" alt="" width="568" height="335"></p>
<p>Then finally had luck with finding an item which is almost identical to the one I was looking for.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-466" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_success_kid.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>Now that I know about the events over there this question seems relevant.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-465" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_african_kid.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="512"></p>
<p>And similarly to Bad Luck Brian, I would probably have a bitter end if I ever go to Black Friday shopping.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-464" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_most_interesting_man.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="627"></p>
<p>And if still somehow managed to get the last big deal item I would end up like Jack Sparrow (ok, actually that would be kind of cool)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-463" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_jack_sparrow.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"></p>
<p>And there will be trolls as usual, right? (I waited so much to use this meme)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-462" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_insanity_wolf.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>Also Black Friday is great opportunity to train your frugal muscles too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-461" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_advice_duck.jpg" alt="" width="537" height="390"></p>
<p>And finally, let&#8217;s keep one minute silence for the ones who work in stores today.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-460" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_9_leonidas.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="264"></p>
<p><em>Thats all for today folks. And prepare for your Black Friday. Coming soon.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you probably noticed I am trying to get inspiration from actual events/reads for these <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/category/funny-friday/">Funny Friday</a> posts. As it turned out you get a lot of different stimulus across the week, so finding a pattern or a theme can be hard sometimes. Honestly, I am thinking hard on dumping the themed editions idea and just fall back to a weekly roundup version. Anyway, what I am sure about that this Funny Friday series will change somehow in the future, just did not get to a decision yet.</p>
<p>Lately read about the positive or negative financial habits of some famous actors, like <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/07/johnny-depp-financial-crisis-money">Johnny Depp</a>, <a href="https://www.thefrugalgene.com/lifestyle-inflation/">Nicolas Cage</a> and Woody Harrelson (will add the link when I find it, I promise). Then I thought I will have a look at their net worths which lead me to <a href="https://www.therichest.com/top-lists/top-100-richest-actors/">this list</a>. It was obvious that I will not create a proper financial meme from all of them, but I chose some of my favorites. I hope you will like them.</p>
<h2>#6 Mel Gibson &#8211; $425M</h2>
<p>He had a lot of great acts, but probably Braveheart was the most memorable. I tried to bring a little bit of actuality for his words though.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-433" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_mel_gibson.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Mel-Gibson" width="413" height="478"></p>
<h2>#8 Sylvester Stallone &#8211; $400M</h2>
<p>Most of the people adore his action movies (cannot blame them, he is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_(film_series)">Rambo</a> after all), others prefer the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_(film_series)">Rocky series</a>. Maybe I am a weirdo, but for me his best movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102603/">Oscar</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-434" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_sylvester_stallone.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Sylvester-Stallone" width="620" height="465"></p>
<h2>#10 Tom Hanks &#8211; $350M</h2>
<p>I devour nearly everything what has a touch from him both as an actor or as a director. I am very picky about war themed movies, but&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185906/">Band of Brothers</a>&nbsp;is definitely one of my favorites and I cannot tell a single film which I was not able to watch having him as an actor.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-431" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_tom_hanks.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Tom-Hanks" width="400" height="270"></p>
<h2>#18 Leonardo DiCaprio &#8211; $245M</h2>
<p>Despite I pigeonholed him after Titanic I have to admit that almost all his movies are great and some of them like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264464/">Catch Me If You Can</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130884/">Shutter Island</a> are epic. Probably another contrarian opinion, but I was not able to watch the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/">Wolf of Wall Street</a>, after a while is started to become a big crying over rich people&#8217;s first world problems.&nbsp;<a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/why-arent-you-stealing-from-the-government/">This post</a> was also an inspiration for this meme, thanks <a href="http://freedomisgroovy.com/">Mr. Groovy.</a></p>

<h2>#26 Johnny Depp &#8211; $200M</h2>
<p>You can love him or hate him (or blame him for his questionable money habits) he is a legend and his acting is genious. Deal with it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-430" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny_friday_8_johnny_depp.jpg" alt="Funny-Friday-Johnny-Depp" width="620" height="413"></p>
<p><em>I plan to keep updating this post in the future to include as many actors as I can from the list. You may ask, why? Well, because I like great movies (who don&#8217;t?) and the research was great fun. So keep an eye on this <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Have a Funny Friday!</em></p>
