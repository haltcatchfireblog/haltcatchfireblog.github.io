										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all,&nbsp;by FIREplace I meant the place where you retire to. I bet your instinctive answer to this question would be a huge YES. Also, probably you are already envisioning yourself enjoying the sun on a sandy beach in Spain, France or Italy. Or maybe you prefer indulging into the great fun what a capital city like London could offer? Or even would you just spend your time wandering around in the Alps in Switzerland or Germany? Riding a bike in Netherland or sweating in a sauna in Sweden? The list could go on and on. To be honest I cannot blame you and probably you are right.</p>
<p>But I want to discuss a different area today. We are heading to the eastern parts. As you may know, <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/escaping-the-matrix/">I am living in northern Serbia</a> so we will discuss local options. The numbers could be identical or pretty similar at least for other areas in the neighborhood. Narrow down this area to the places I know about from experience so let&#8217;s say my statements stand for Vojvodina (Serbia), Hungary and Transylvania (Romania).</p>
<p>Now it’s a fact that in the latest years this area is a not the place what comes to mind when you are thinking about where to move. People are leaving these ends in dozens every day searching for a better life in western Europe. I could not really point to a single family around here which does not have a member or a friend (or more) who works and lives abroad. The great majority is driven by financial reasons others by political or simply lifestyle preferences. Can not blame them, this area is not the best place for the average Joe for hoarding wealth. I would lie if I’d say I have never been tempted to leave. To be honest I am thinking about that option every now and then.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-991" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hitcher-1536748_1920-1024x681.jpg" alt="Hitcher" width="640" height="426"></p>
<p>Same time I always see people (unfortunately in very small numbers) who after living abroad for many long years finally gets defeated by homesickness and return to here. While that is a huge driving force there are other benefits of returning to the homeland after you have a steady pension or sufficient savings. In comparison to the states or even western Europe, this is a low-cost area.</p>
<p>Needs and wants in early retirement are very subjective things and highly affected by the lifestyle you used to live. I cannot promise that this area can provide you with everything, so for the sake of this thought experiment let’s assume that you are satisfied with what our little country could offer at other fields of life and let’s focus on the numbers. I will try to summarize the basic financial needs for living in the area looking for multiple options for spending ranges. So let&#8217;s see the &#8220;big three&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Housing</h2>
<p>There is the eternal debate of renting or buying but we will not cover that now. There are too many variables for every situation so let&#8217;s get some examples for both.&nbsp;This place is no different than others, the rental prices are highly dependent on the location and the type of the property.</p>
<h3>Renting</h3>
<p>If you are ok with living in the countryside you can find cheap accommodation in villages or small towns. The only problem here is to find a suitable property (the renting out culture is not that widely spread here). There is a chance that you will not find a flat in such areas but if you can find a house for rent you can probably get it for $70-$150/month. I heard about folks who were able to get a rental and not paying a dime for it just taking care of the place (while the owners were working abroad).</p>
<p>Small-medium sized cities are a little bit more expensive but also could offer more entertainment by the western standards. There is a chance that you can choose from a bigger assortment. From real-life examples, I could say that you can find a studio apartment (around 375sqft) for $100-$150, a medium-sized (around 540sqft) for $150-$300, and a big one (above 1000sqft) for $300-$500 per month. Rental houses are not as frequent here as they should be (trust me we were searching for one with no luck) but where you can find some the prices would be similar to flat rentals only houses can be found at more distant locations.</p>
<p>Big cities are the ones which I would avoid at any costs, but if you insist and want to find a reasonable and acceptable flat you would probably shell out similar amounts as in the western countries. The variability is so high that I would not even try to guesstimate exact numbers, but it could be anywhere above $500 and the sky is the limit.</p>
<h3>Buying</h3>
<p>Following the same distinction at smaller places, you can find properties for even a couple thousand dollars. I heard about whole farms which were bought for less than $10k (taxes and other expenses included). A good estimation for average house prices at these places is on the $10k-$30k scale depending on the size.</p>
<p>In medium-sized cities, flat prices vary from $750-$1250 per square meter (10sqft). Seemingly the real estate market is growing finally, there are a dozen constructions going on just in our city so we could say that there is a nice assortment. From my experience house prices for acceptable properties with average sizes (around 1500sqft home size on a 5000-7500sqft plot) would cost you $45k-$70k.</p>
<p>For big cities the situation is the same as for rentals, the prices could be similar to western mid-size places. Anyway assume a number north of the upper limits of the previous paragraph.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-994" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/house-970344_1920-1024x678.jpg" alt="House" width="640" height="424"></p>
<h3>Utilities</h3>
<p>In terms of utilities, I can only speak about my (and my peers) experiences. We used to live in a flat and our monthly bills added up to $110 per month on average. When we moved to our house our expenses rosed a bit thanks to heating bills. Electricity, water + sewer costs, waste removal, natural gas, landline + internet for our household averages around $200 per month. Your location does not really affect these numbers, the size of your home does.</p>
<h2>Transportation</h2>
<p>You should know two things about public transportation in Serbia. The first thing is that the tickets are not expensive. The second thing is that as a bonus you get an instant time travel 50 years back. While there are exceptions most vehicles are remainings of the last century and a lot of them are older than me.</p>
<h3>Railways</h3>
<p>My grandfather told me nice stories about the great Yugoslavian railways. <a href="https://www.haltcatchfire.com/three-financial-lessons/">I wrote about him earlier</a> and told you that he was a &#8220;gastarbeiter&#8221; in Germany and he used the railways back then. The huge problem is that if you are not living in the middle of the country (around the capital city, Belgrade) if you see a newer train it is probably a foreign one. The rest of them are the same ones my grandpa used.</p>
<p>I had some friends who commuted to school by train. The rule was that if the train was not able to start in the morning the railway&nbsp;company provided an excuse to them for skipping the school that day. Once I was waiting for my train departure at 7&#8217;o clock in the morning. The first news was about a ten minute late. At 2 PM&nbsp;I gave up and went home. So, definitely not recommended for a daily commute.</p>
<p>Before I totally scare you away from using the railways in Serbia I have to tell that as a rule of thumb the longer the line of travel and the more international the line is the higher the probability is that the trip will actually happen. I used to travel a couple of times from the top of Serbia all the way down to the shores of the Adriatic sea in Montenegro for roughly 50 bucks. Also, if you want to experience the true essence of the Balkans I really recommend taking longer trips by train here. Expect something like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raby3rkC7Do">this video</a>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Bus companies</h3>
<p>As the glory of the railways was fading bus companies were breaking forth just to step on the same path. Again there are exceptions. As a rule of thumb the bigger the company is and have long and/or international lines the newer and better are the vehicles. The oldest ones are running between smaller towns and in public transport in small-medium sized cities. I remember a movie about the Montgomery bus boycott. Well, today I was traveling on a similar vehicle, maybe a little bit dirtier <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Again, prices are in correlation with the quality of the service. A local one-way bus ticket is $0.9, the monthly ticket is $25. Interurban lines are selling for roughly $0.15/mile. The exceptions are the international lines like the one to Austria. These are newer vehicles and a one-way ticket is $45. Tourist agencies have also good vehicles and fair prices, you can buy a return ticket to Chalkidiki, Greece for $70-80 per person.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-992" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bus-2423983_1920-695x1024.jpg" alt="Bus" width="640" height="943"></p>
<h3>Taxy &amp; Uber..ish companies</h3>
<p>Uber is non-existent over here but has some local flavors like&nbsp;<a href="http://appcargo.net/">CarGo</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.rs.blablacar.gg/">BlaBlaCar</a>. These are unfortunately usable only in bigger cities but you can find a taxi at pretty much every town. The prices are around $0.8 per km which I consider relatively cheap compared to western fares.</p>
<h3>Car ownership</h3>
<p>This is a topic worth a separate post alone so, for now, I would only tell that new car prices are relatively high, cars are not cheaper than in the western countries where salaries are multiples of ours. This sucks, I know but we are frugal folks after all so we buy only new to us cars, right?</p>
<p>Again a topic for a different day, but in terms of the used car market, you can buy a reliable smaller hatchback for $5-7k which can serve for a decade at least. Expect higher fuel prices than over the pond, still, if you travel in a group this could be a more economical option. If I don&#8217;t take the purchase price into account just the fuel and maintenance costs a family of four could probably travel by car for less (half-price to same cost range) than a bus ticket on a specific distance.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>And last but not least we reached the biggest positive factor in living here. As in a dominantly agricultural area, the local ingredients are relatively cheap and high in quality. Would not make a list myself here, but bumped into <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/food-prices/country_result.jsp?country=Serbia&amp;displayCurrency=USD">this great statistic site</a> lately. If you follow the link you can find a pretty accurate list from the basics and you can estimate your expenses based on your grocery buying habits. Let&#8217;s see some actual tips how should you get your food.</p>
<h3>Straight from the producer</h3>
<p>At almost every place there is someone who knows someone who produces this or that. While this is not an option for everyone if you can discover such a channel respect it as you probably found gold. This is the way to get the highest quality for the lowest price especially if you buy in bulk or if you become a loyal customer. If you are going through a village or small town and you see goods on a table or in buckets next to the road look for the owner, they will happy to serve you and even jump into juicy negotiations. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Farmers market</h3>
<p>The second best option and the best for the ones who like to do regular grocery shopping tours and get everything in one place. Vegetables, fruits, meat products and diaries are high in variability and the prices are good. The only important thing here is to always try to discover producers and try to avoid wholesalers to get the best quality for your money. Also, don&#8217;t really believe if you see an organic or bio label on anything. This trend is just conquering these parts and not totally respected by producers. I know about farmers who said when someone asked what is the difference between the bio and not bio versions that the non-bio producers are using chemicals by daylight&#8230;</p>
<h3>Supermarkets &amp; Hypermarkets</h3>
<p>These are offering pretty much everything exactly like anywhere else. The assortment is abundant, local stuff is dominant but you can find all the world-class brands and products. You should buy in bulk here everything you do not manage to get at the first two options.</p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-993" src="https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/barbecue-1239145_1920-1024x778.jpg" alt="Meat" width="640" height="486"></h3>
<h3>Local food</h3>
<p>Ok, we reached even the most interesting part of this section. Similarly to cars this worth a separate post alone. If you are curious about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_cuisine">detailed list of the Serbian cuisine you can find it here</a>. Bakeries are the go to places in the morning to enjoy a full-filling burek (although not the healthiest choice) with jog(no h here)urt of course (for roughly $1.5-$2). Grill bars are literally everywhere, every little town has at least one of them. Unfortunately, they are renovating them to look more like fast food restaurants. Still, the end product is the same: tasty grilled meats and plenty of fresh veggies. You have to visit these places at lunch AND dinnertime ($2-$5/per meal). Yes, as you may be guessed your stomach <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/serbia/articles/11-traditional-serbian-dishes-you-need-to-try/">will be pampered here</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Oh, and at the end of the day you could still have only $10-$15 spent.</p>
<h3>Restaurants</h3>
<p>As a closing accord, I have to say that most of the restaurants over here are pretty good. They serve tasty meals for reasonable prices and most of the times the amounts are more than plenty. Of course in bigger cities, you could go for maximum fanciness at stellar prices but a reasonable small-middle sized city can offer you a very good quality and huge portions for around $5-$10 per meal. Even if I take into account the best restaurant in our town if you don&#8217;t pick something exotic (like sea-fish) you could fill your stomach for $8-$20. Add a glass of excellent local wine or artisan beer which would add another $3-$5 to the bill. Sounds tempting?</p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Living at our ends has its pros and cons just like any other place. This area is definitely not the best place for chasing FIRE. The only exception is if you can take advantage of geoarbitrage like hundreds of local companies and especially thousands of freelancers who provide high-quality professional services for the western world for western salaries. But as you were able to realize for now if you find the environment, the culture and the people over here a fit for your taste the countries of central-eastern Europe can be a tempting choice as a FIREplace. If nothing more, definitely worth an extended visit after you reached FIRE <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><em>What about you? Would you be able to retire to such a place? Do these numbers make these end tempting for FIREd folks? Share your ideas in the comments! See you soon.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Welcome back geeky FIRE seekers. Today I brought you the story of my newest (ex)coder-blogger friend all the way from the heart of Europe. Shame on me, I only found out about the existence of their great blog,&nbsp;<a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/">WhatLifeCouldBe.eu</a>&nbsp; a couple of weeks ago but digging through it is in progress. It turned out that they are very close to us both in terms of family situations and geographical distance. Enjoy!</i></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Tell us about yourself!</h3>
<p>Heya. I&#8217;m Rob. We&#8217;re a Scottish (her) Hungarian (him) couple with two young kids who reached FI at 32 years while living in Germany. We started investing in real estate, started several side hustles, a profitable business and also invest in the stock market with ETFs. After more than 10 years in Germany, we moved to rural Romania where I&#8217;m from and where my parents live.</p>
<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<h3>When was your first encounter with computing?</h3>
<p>I picked the IT class at high school (9-12th grade) so I started with 14 years to learn about coding and by my 18th birthday I did my first proper piece of software.</p>
<h3>What was your first machine?</h3>
<p>It must have been around &#8217;97, it was an Intel Pentium 166Ghz, 1Gb HDD and&#8230; pff&#8230; less than 512Mb Ram. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It was a great PC. Later I&#8217;ve got a Voodoo graphics accelerator and I rocked Tomb Rider on it&#8230;</p>
<h3>Did you started with games first or jumped straight into programming?</h3>
<p>Well, in Romania back then nobody bought licenses so I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time hacking some PC games to make them work. I&#8217;ve learned a lot. I think this was the reason we have so many good developers now in Romania.</p>
<h3>What about education? Was it related to computing? Did you learn in a traditional way? What kind of degree do you have?</h3>
<p>Yeah, it was IT focused. Algorithms, Pascal and it got quite sophisticated with Backtracking and Recursivity. I then went to IT&amp; Economics which was a really good choice since it gives you insight in so many areas like marketing, management, finances, accounting, HR, stock market etc plus, 50% was coding.</p>
<h3>When did you start to work? Was it in your field?</h3>
<p>I always wanted to be a web programmer (PHP &amp; MySQL) right from the start of university. I actually became one and started working in this area. A couple of years of professional coding was enough for me to realize I don&#8217;t enjoy that so much and I gradually switched to consulting.</p>
<h3>How did you become an entrepreneur?</h3>
<p>I think it all started back in 1999 or so when I&#8217;ve got a CD burner and burned CDs for people for money <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I made enough money to buy a Dial-Up modem <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I remember that&#8230; Later I started making money with building websites from scratch. On paper, I became an entrepreneur by coincidence. The Germans didn&#8217;t want to give me work permit so the solution was to become a freelancer. Which I did. This meant, that I could keep those few little clients I had before and also have a kinda fulltime job as well. This was quite nice.</p>
<p>This was also an important milestone in my life. As a freelancer, I didn&#8217;t have to pay state pension. This made me a bit worried about my pension. I knew I had to do something and the private pension plans were not very appealing so this is when we started investing in real estate.</p>
<h3>What kind of services did you provide?</h3>
<p>I did the usual little websites. It started from scratch then the frameworks (Joomla) appeared. Then PHP / MySQL / JavaScript coding followed. Before I &#8220;retired&#8221; I&#8217;ve only used JavaScript a bit.</p>
<h3>What are your experiences about the industry?</h3>
<p>I didn&#8217;t really enjoy the fast-changing technology. It always felt a bit like hacking, especially with JavaScript. So I&#8217;m not the sort of person who sits in a dark room and codes all night. I&#8217;ve done that, now I know I don&#8217;t like it. The industry? Well, huge future. Software and algorithms are going to shape our future world more and more. Look at Uber, the world&#8217;s biggest taxi company who don&#8217;t really own cars. Look at Amazon, the biggest online shop who don&#8217;t really produce anything and the list could go on and on. If you learn how to code, you&#8217;re future proof.</p>
<h3>What were your biggest challenge, failure, and success?</h3>
<p>My biggest challenge was my first project. I had to build one for my graduation. I was so proud of myself. I felt like there are no limits to what I could build in that programming language (FoxPro). Loved the feeling.</p>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<h3>What is your current financial situation and what are your financial goals?</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re FI for about 3 years now but, as it happens we&#8217;re still earning money with stuff we enjoy doing.</p>
<h3>Would you share your FI strategy and journey briefly?</h3>
<p>Basically, we&#8217;re pretty diversification freaks. We invested a lot in real estate (1st pillar), I started an online business (2nd pillar), we both have skills that we can use anytime to make money (3rd pillar) and all that left is going to the stock market (4th pillar) if we feel like it&#8217;s good time to invest. We wrote about this <a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2016/01/02/financial-independence-strategy">strategy here</a> and this is <a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2015/12/03/financial-independence-in-9-years/">how we reached FI</a> in detail.</p>
<h3>How did your profession affect your finances?</h3>
<p>Fun fact about us is, that our highest paying side hustle (150-209€/h) had nothing to do with our professions (<a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2016/01/24/how-to-earn-154-an-hour-without-a-degree">see details here</a>), which was a caretaker job we did for 1.5 years. So if you ask me whether you need to be a coder or engineer to reach FI, my answer would be absolutely not!</p>
<p>Still, being a coder and having experience in building websites helped us a lot reaching FI, no question about that. The thing is, that if you have a good idea for a portal, a software or an App it can catapult you into FI in no time (sometimes a year or less could be enough). It allows you to build your money-making-machine, your source of passive income if you use your skills wisely.</p>
<h2>Opinions</h2>
<h3>Did you regret becoming a coder? What would you change?</h3>
<p>Being a coder helped my consultant career a lot. I had to deal with IT guys and they like to talk to consultants who know their &#8220;language&#8221;. Most consultants in my field didn&#8217;t have a coder background and for me, this made a huge difference.</p>
<p>If I could, I would change the educations system in a way that it allows kids to find their passion as quickly as possible and I would let them focus on that rather than learn about chemistry if you clearly want to become a coder.</p>
<p>What would I change in my career? I would start being properly self-employed a lot earlier.</p>
<h3>Would you recommend starters/career shifters to step on this path?</h3>
<p>If they enjoy it yes. If not&#8230;no&#8230; One should do what one enjoys doing. But EVERYBODY should learn a bit of algorithms and coding early on so the can decide for themselves. It should be mandatory!</p>
<h3>Do you have some tips for beginners?</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t sit in front of the TV or on Facebook so much. Start thinking about what you really want to do. What do you want to build? Virtually everything could be learned from the internet. Start doing it. Invest in your education. Not necessarily money, but time.</p>
<h3>Whom do you recommend indulging in entrepreneurship?</h3>
<p>I think everybody should be offered the chance to try different forms of entrepreneurship. They could then choose for themselves if they enjoy doing it.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<h3>You are a coder, a freelancer, an internet marketer, an online business owner, a blogger, a community builder, a real estate investor, and who knows what else <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Would you share your goals and plans for these projects with us?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve quit my coding customers long ago so this is not an issue anymore&#8230; I&#8217;m an ex-coder <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I quit my consulting customers mid-2017. It paid well (over 100€/h) and I could do it remotely but I felt like my work doesn&#8217;t really have any impact on anything I felt even slightly meaningful so I dropped it.</p>
<p>My only business is my baby. I love watching it grow, watching all the new features it can do every other day. I like the fact that I can have a real positive impact on the lives of thousands of people. So yeah, I have no plans of stopping this although, who knows. Next year I might have my focus on other stuff.</p>
<p><a href="http://firehub.eu/">FIREhub.eu</a> is a project we started at the Financial Independence Week Europe 2017 with a few other European folks. It should be the home for everything about FIRE in Europe with a curated articles list, blogs list, Wiki, Events, and Podcasts. It&#8217;s a not-for-profit project and I&#8217;d like to see other people jumping onboard and see it grow. It&#8217;s also a platform we use to get to know many interesting people.</p>
<p><a href="http://whatlifecouldbe.eu/fiwe-2018/">FIWE</a> &#8211; the Financial Independence Week Europe is a fun, not-for-profit conference-meetup that we started in 2016 and in June 2018 we have the 3rd edition. We love to meet new amazing people, make friends and connect people. We enjoy it a lot, it&#8217;s also something that Emma (my wife) and I are doing together (apart from our blog). It&#8217;s quite important for us as a couple to have shared projects.</p>
<p>On the real estate side, we don&#8217;t plan on expanding. In fact, we might even sell some in the future. We don&#8217;t really enjoy dealing with tenants. Luckily we don&#8217;t have to do that too much. It&#8217;s pretty passive.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget that we&#8217;re also parents to two really sophisticated, energy-intensive little creatures. I don&#8217;t even understand how we have time to do anything else&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh&#8230;we&#8217;re also environmental activists and we want to make the world plastic free and idiots free. I know we have a long way to go&#8230; but hey, you have to start somewhere&#8230; My next goal is to make my hometown sustainably cleaner and stop the authorities dumping all the plastic waste from the town into&#8230; you guessed it&#8230; a lake. Not nice isn&#8217;t it. It&#8217;s quite challenging to find solutions here without getting in trouble&#8230;</p>

<pre>FI = getYourShitTogether()

function getYourShitTogether() {
    tv=FALSE;
    stupid-expenses = startTrackingYourExpenses();
    expenses = expenses - stupid-expenses;

    array_sh=thinkAboutSideHustles();
    passive_income = implementSideHustles(array_sh);

    self-employment= thinkAboutABusiness();
    passive_income += implementBusiness(self-employment)

    return passive_income - expenses;
}</pre>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p><em>Thank you, Rob, for participating in this series. It was very interesting to get to know your tech background and professional journey more. I honestly think that it is very interesting and we can learn a lot from you about hard work, following your dreams and most importantly bending the system to fit your goals <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>
<p><em>While this post is going online somewhere at a lovely place at Timisoara a bunch of European FIRE folks are gathering to have a great weekend at FIWE 2018 conference. A huge shout out to all of you and wishing a lot of fun, interesting conversations and plenty of good wine and food for the following days.</em></p>
<p><em>Hope you enjoyed this episode.&nbsp;</em><em>See you soon.</em></p>
