I have no experience with Bosnia but assuming a similar situation. Yes, you can live a pretty comfy middle-class life for much less than in the western parts. A friend of mine who moved to London (then moved back a couple of years later) was complaining that before New Year&#039;s Eve they were hunting for a suckling pig to roast and barely managed to find one. Also, the price was almost ten times higher. Well, this is a luxury you can easily afford over here. Damn, why am I constantly talking about food? :D Anyway thanks for reading!]]></description>

That could be a good choice, however, the cost of living raise in recent years. Still could be inexpensive by western standards. Maybe a coincidence but we were discussing exactly this option last week with my coworkers and we agreed that could be a realistic scenario.
I like the area, though I haven&#039;t been there for almost three decades now. Definitely planning a family vacation in the following years to revive those memories :)]]></description>

The area definitely worth at least a prolonged country road trip. In terms of the language, the rule of thumb is the bigger the city the better position you are in. You could get by English pretty good in Hungary, it is a popular place for outlanders :) Not sure about Transylvania/Romania, but I assume the situation is the same as it is a very tourist oriented area. Not by accident, they have world-class sights which you barely can see elsewhere. Finally, in Serbia, you can also get by with English just look for younger folks. Serbian youth is pretty good at English in my opinion. The root of this is in entertainment. They rarely translate movies so most of the kids spent their childhood watching English speaking films and cartoons and you know, the young brain is like a sponge. So don&#039;t stress over getting yourself understand too much :)]]></description>

Interesting points. I haven&#039;t been to the states or Germany but is definitely on my bucket list. Not sure if I would like to spend a lot of time over there, but definitely would have an extended trip around (ok, that would take a lot of time alone:) ). I would recommend visiting the places I mentioned have a lot of exceptional sights and lifetime experiences are guaranteed with a moderate price tag. If I have to make a final conclusion and if I try to look at the area with the eyes of a western retiree probably a medium city in Hungary would be the perfect choice as a FIREplace. Who knows, maybe even I will end up there :) Thanks for reading!]]></description>

What&#039;s the language situation? Could one get by in English? What languages are spoken by locals?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d absolutely move to eastern Europe, and I haven&#039;t even been there yet.  I&#039;ve seen many places in western Europe and wouldn&#039;t mind  FIREing to many of them.  We&#039;re going to Hungary in October, so I&#039;ll get my first taste of eastern Europe.  

The one place I know I don&#039;t want to move is back to the United States.  I do miss family there, but that&#039;s it.]]></description>
