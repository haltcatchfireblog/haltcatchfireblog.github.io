Totally agree with you. You know eating an elephant can only be done one way: one bite at a time. :) Thanks for stepping by!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the great, simple productivity tips. As a matter of fact its little hints that will help us change habits. I am a big believer in changing habits and thus achieving gradual improvement as opposed to ground breaking behavioral changes (which also work but are hard and painful ;-)]]></description>

I can happily say that carrying the kids by bike to the kindergarten is pretty common here. Unfortunately despite I was thinking about getting a trailer I am not sure if it could handle our roads. I don&#039;t know what would happen on the narrower roads, sometimes it is hard to navigate among the cars. I don&#039;t even dare to use bike roads here, some dirt race tracks are smoother than these :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hahah... I have the same voices in my head! Since my wife and me read MMM, we tend not to use elevators anymore. We also became a &quot;weird&quot; attraction in our town because we both ride bikes and take our kids to nursery with bike trailers. :)]]></description>

Can anyone be truly productive without a peaceful mind? Having that two in a balanced amount creates harmony, right?

Good to know that I am not the only one :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent! I like how you blend productivity with peace in this post. You made me want to take a nap, and then run and down the stairs! ;-)

I can totally relate to &quot;the voice of Pete&quot; as well. I get nagged every single day I drive into work.]]></description>
