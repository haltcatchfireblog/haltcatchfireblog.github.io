					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haltcatchfire.com/the-only-thing-i-dont-get-about-reaching-fire/#comment-54&quot;&gt;Early Retirement Dude&lt;/a&gt;.

Oh, Dude, after providing us so many insight of your life, journey, and retirement through your posts I could believe you almost anything.

If you had not finished your comment with that line I would. I experience this very often (not anywhere close to ER), the guilt for not using my time the best possible way. However, I try to remind myself that we are just mortal human beings, probably not designed to burn with high octane all the time.

It is similar that you cannot succeed all the time. You experiment and you fail sometimes. Through the years I discovered some activities which became part of my life and others did not. I have my share of regrets about them, but how would I know that I don&#039;t like and don&#039;t profit from them if I don&#039;t even try? Sometimes you know at the first sight if something is not for you (like Facebook for me). Sometimes you have to do it for a while to find out (like MMORPGs for me). Still, sometimes if I decide to watch a specific film and turns out that it is crap I become upset and I ask myself that how could I get back that 90 mins of my life? So I hear you on feeling guilty. 

I have read your post about gaming lately and I think the most important thing is to have the controller in your hand. But the same stand for watching movies, reading books, drinking coffee, alcohol or even smoking weed sometimes. Until you have control over your actions, you enjoy doing it and you don&#039;t hurt anyone (including yourself) I am ok with it.

Thank you for your comment!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Trust me, manâ€¦after thirteen years of retirement, I know boredom well. It&#039;s inevitable. Doing your best to fill your time with various projects is good; bear in mind that as you Tetris those blocks of time together, you WILL leave gaps.

I think the real danger isn&#039;t these blocks of unstructured free time, thoughâ€¦I think it&#039;s the danger of feeling guilty for filling those blocks with so-called junk food pastimes. Some people think gaming is junk food, others think binging on Netflix is junk food, still others think surfing Facebook for hours is junk food. I personally don&#039;t judge. If you&#039;re not hurting anybody, do what you like.

Life is short, however, and at some point you have to reconcile yourself with the fact that whatever you fill your free time with, you won&#039;t get those hours back. Guilt, then, may arise from thinking or overthinking what you have to show for all those hours.

All that&#039;s a fact of life, of course, and it applies both to people who have left the workforce and to people who haven&#039;t.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that lack of direction is frightening. For me, my work is often open ended. And I can genuinely attest to the fact that sometimes open ended is as hard as it gets!

Of course open ended is filled with all the magic of your imagination, but when it comes to FIRE, I think that what fills people with fear is the fact that they never before imagined being so free (or that it would even be possible).]]></description>

I agree that it is ok, but there are some people out there who use this as an excuse to rationalize their lack of effort towards this goal (not my business btw) or even worse, offend/distract others who are working towards FIRE.

Sounds like a plan. :) For me, family time would come first connected with hobbies and travel. Then in the free time can come value creation.

Thanks for reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think if people say they don&#039;t know what they&#039;d do if they retire, it just means they haven&#039;t found out what they&#039;re really passionate about yet. And that&#039;s okay, not everyone knows right away.

Like for me, I didn&#039;t really know - and then after I started blogging I realized I loved helping people learn about money and how to handle their finances, and about creating strong, healthy relationships with others. I&#039;ll likely write some and perhaps do some sort of coaching/counseling and volunteer work to fill my time.

But first, probably a bit of down time where I don&#039;t do anything for about a month or two. :)]]></description>
