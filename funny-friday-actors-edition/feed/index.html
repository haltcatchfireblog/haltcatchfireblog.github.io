Thanks, Cubert. Good idea. Unfortunately I started a low information diet a couple of years ago, so stars have to do very idiotic things to reach me through the news. Most of the times I got informed from friends and coworkers. Of course I could do some research, will have a look.
I know what can you probably think now, &quot;Oh man, he is not into smart phones, don&#039;t use a GPS and now it turns out that don&#039;t watch TV, maybe he isn&#039;t a real IT guy? Or just lying?&quot; :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tee hee! You could probably make up some real doozies with real life actor shots - like when Mel got his ass dragged to the precinct for drunk driving. &quot;I don&#039;t always get drunk, but when I do, I get absolutely shit faced and lose all sense of decency...&quot; Nice post!]]></description>

Thank you J$. If only I had a dollar for every time someone said this. I would have 3 dollars... It is hard sometimes to make them, but when in the end there is at least one in a set which makes me smile after multiple read I know it worth the time creating it :)]]></description>
