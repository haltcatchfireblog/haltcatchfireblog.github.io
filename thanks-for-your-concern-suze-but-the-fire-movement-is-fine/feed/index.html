Thank you, Mr. G! She is totally right about the concerns but she was speaking about a movement without truly knowing the principles. She made a decision just by seeing the top of the iceberg which is exactly the thing most everyday people does when hearing about FIRE. Educating yourself frees your mind. Trust me, I am FIRE fan living in a country where my last meme is closer to the reality...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, HCF. Very nice summation of the great Suze Orman kerfuffle. I&#039;m not a Suze hater and generally believe she&#039;s been a help in the personal finance realm. But on FIRE she&#039;s wrong. If you own your house and car outright, live in a low-cost state, and spend mindfully, you can FIRE with a million dollar portfolio--especially when you account for things such as pensions and entitlements (Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare). Great post, my friend.]]></description>

Hey Steveark, good to see you around.

I never thought that she must be a bad person just because her opinion is different. You are probably right and this is just a piece of her comeback strategy. Actually, she is good in that indeed, found a currently hyped financial trend, escalated a debate and driven by our emotions we gave her the attention she thirsted.]]></description>

Thanks for your detailed comment.

Honestly, I know that much about the US medical industry how I am reading on PF blogs. As much as I understand having sufficient insurance, despite it could be expensive a must have. But at least you know upfront what to expect. In my country healthcare is &quot;free&quot;, they get 10.3% percent of your salary (5.15% paid by you and 5.15% paid by your employer). But the system is bleeding from a thousand scars. So better to have some kind of private insurance over here also, but I know no one who has such a thing...

Many countries have problems with the SS system also these days, and we are not an exception again. They get a huge cut of your money (26% of your salary, 14% deducted from you and 12% from your employer) still barely can keep up with the payouts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You cannot take a performers words as literal.  Her ability to stage a comeback depends on making a big splash, and she made one.  Plus the FIRE community is very small, microscopic compared to her intended audience, the massive group of worried underfunded Boomers and GenX&#039;rs  who don&#039;t know about FIRE and wouldn&#039;t buy into it if they did.  She wants to own them and doesn&#039;t want the FIRE community anywhere near them.  She&#039;s crazy like a fox.  And in person she is a very nice and sweet woman who is extremely kind to those around her.

					<description><![CDATA[HCF - great post, I really enjoyed reading it.

I can understand one thing that Suze brings up:  A lot of people in the USA go bankrupt because of medical bills.  She&#039;s showing some concern for the folks that will have unexpected medical bills and disabilities and face financial ruin because of it.

I think she has done a great job of generating some publicity for her book - she&#039;s a pro, no doubt.

Ultimately, she just doesn&#039;t understand that folks in the FIRE community don&#039;t ALL plan on &quot;retiring&quot; in the way that she tried to do for a few years.  Most plan on &quot;working&quot; and still bringing in some income, just on their own terms and by doing things they love to do.  

I think she&#039;s just a little out of touch with what it is all about, maybe she got too much sun while on her yacht and private island.  
I did laugh when she said we need to keep working so we can pay taxes into Social Security so it doesn&#039;t fall apart, sounds like something someone who receives a SS check would say.]]></description>

As I stated, the proper questions are HOW and WHEN. It can happen that reaching FIRE seems impossible according to your current situation. Or like in my case, with a lower salary not impossible, but would take a very long time (20+ years). So it is essential to acquire the mindset which is necessary for improving your situation over time thus accelerating your journey. Thanks for chiming in ;)]]></description>

Thank you! I was proud for that idea myself (blush)

If we assume she has no ulterior motives then this is the only logical explanation as I can not believe that someone with a financial knowledge like hers is unable to understand the principles, the evidence and the outcomes.]]></description>
