Wow, just checked it and this game is as old as me myself :)

My first game which I can recall was Paperboy, but I get it on a magnetic tape. Still, the melancholy factor is too damn high :D]]></description>

OthalaFehu, the mental image you paint isn&#039;t far from the truth!

The year before my high school bought those shitty IBM-clones we all had to do 6 weeks of typing lessons (on typewriters!). 

To teach us to touch-type, the teacher taped a piece of paper over the keyboard. Our hands were under the paper, our eyes were over it, so that we couldn&#039;t see the keys.  

We had to type out a passage from a book, while every typo was met with a whack across the back of the hand with the edge of a metre long blackboard ruler. 

It would be fair to describe the teaching technique as particularly &quot;motivating&quot; in our pursuit of typing excellence.]]></description>

Thanks, my friend. Unfortunately what you described is not just a fictional mockup situation and not just at for-profit places. My college had such teachers...]]></description>
