					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/brave-new-world/#comment-365&quot;&gt;{ in·deed·a·bly }&lt;/a&gt;.

I have to admit that I was thinking about changing the &quot;efficient government&quot; idea to the &quot;working fusion reactor&quot; but my latest real-life experiences made me wishing for the former even more than the latter :D

I cannot count how many times I have seen Wall-E but I still cannot get enough of it. However, I don&#039;t think that our future will look like that. Advanced decision-making systems will do their thing. Robots will handle everything they can. Still, with all my skepticism/pessimism about the human race is taken into account, I can not imagine that all of the remainings of mankind would voluntarily immerse into such a sedentary, contentless and meaningless existence. There will always be self-motivated people who will ask for more.

Just like most of the lucky ones who were able the FIRE themselves don&#039;t just sit back, watch television all day and wait for the reaper to come for them. Many of them use their newfound freedom to do some good with his/her fellow human beings, put a positive mark on this world and make it a better place. Or am I just lucky enough to know at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/2019/08/02/fi-is-a-superpower-our-community-has-to-take-advantage-of/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;a couple of them&lt;/a&gt;?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You paint an appealing vision of the future HCF! Though I must confess your optimism that governmental bureaucracy will ever sort itself out and become efficient is possibly a leap too far. 

I wonder whether the end of that journey lies with us being like the humans in the movie Wall-E? Computers making all the decisions, and robots doing all the work, while we lounge around in blissful ignorance watching cat videos and sharing the latest internet meme.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://haltcatchfireblog.github.io/brave-new-world/#comment-363&quot;&gt;Mr.RTFM&lt;/a&gt;.

Ironically, you are right. I just realized that I did not point this out. What I meant that I envision having all these quality content in a huge &quot;library&quot;, linked together in a sorted and structured way accessible from a single education interface which will serve as the foundation of that future school. I honestly believe that the revolution of education is a must-have and it is around the corner.

On the other hand, when I take into account my current struggles... my older daughter will start the elementary school next year and investigating the current options I have to tell that I am not totally impressed. I try to pick the one option which will provide the maximum in the happiness/knowledge ratio but all options seem still pretty outdated. Maybe it will be our task to create a next-gen school for them? Time will tell!

Thank you for reading and for your comment. It feels good being back in the game and comments like yours help to keep the momentum ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;All of them will have access to a huge, highly structured and organized multimedia knowledge base including lectures and books from the top thinkers/scientists/performers of the world.&quot;
Ironically, we have this today, but choose to watch videos of kittens, of people playing video games etc. 
I&#039;d love if this had changed by the time my (not yet existing) kid would go to school, but I&#039;m not that optimistic about human nature. 
I love your other predictions though, and am really glad, that you are back!]]></description>
