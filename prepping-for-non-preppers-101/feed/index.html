I often feel alone advocating for some precious metals in the FIRE forums, I don&#039;t know why it is not accepted as part of a diversification of assets philosophy?]]></description>

Agree. I think gold can take the place of bonds in a standard bond/equity allocation.]]></description>

I think both have its place in your masterplan. Also, having both means more diversification which leads to more security. Am I right? :)]]></description>

Every household should be able to be self-supplying at least for a couple of days/weeks. You never know when will something unexpected happen. The points above are not hard to complete (at least at the basic level) but it could be like the butterfly effect, small changes can cause a huge difference in the future :) Thanks for reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent post! I didn&#039;t realize OthalaFehu was a prepper, so this article caught my eye. While I wouldn&#039;t go so far as to call myself a true prepper (mostly because I don&#039;t fit the stereotype), I think it would be foolish to keep a blind eye towards the future. 

I agree with the previous commenters regarding the puzzling lack of preparedness discussion in the FI community, since the hallmarks of forethought, planning, and knowledge which mark the FIRE trail also light the path to survival preparedness.

The FFP household is at the &quot;Moderate&quot; level on most of the above scale, a few categories excepted. +1 for the reference to the Encyclopedia of Country Living! That was required reading on the homestead where I grew up. Thanks for the read!]]></description>

Agree with you, especially that we have seen some strange situations even in my lifetime. Fortunately, there were no cases when firearms should be involved but could have been. Anyway, when the sirens sound their warning about incoming bomber airplanes it is not a funny thing. You definitely start to see life in a different way in those situations...]]></description>

I think that this is a similar topic than religion. Some bloggers take the courage and share the thoughts in these even if it could hurt their popularity. Also, I think many have some standpoints but don&#039;t risk sharing them publicly. An interesting question anyway. I blame it on my upbringing that I never got connected to the usage of weapons (besides bows and airguns). If I would live in the states maybe I would have some kind of gun for self-defense purposes.]]></description>

Haha. I like dark humour :) When we were visiting Transylvania back in the days the tour guide gave a survival advice in case of confronting with bears. When everyone starts running away you don&#039;t have to be the first one, just be sure to don&#039;t be the last one :) She also said that in case of snakebite, don&#039;t panic, they have an antidote. The Bible...]]></description>
