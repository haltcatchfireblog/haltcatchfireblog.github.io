I could not argue that fact, but I think also, that what the US symbolized in the past, the place where anything could happen, rags to riches stories, etc. the world wide web made globally reachable. It is also true that physically going there still could help turbocharge this process :)]]></description>

I am happy to see you here and WoW, that sounds like an awesome plan. Croatia is truly beautiful. It&#039;s a shame that I haven&#039;t been there for almost three decades now but it is on the bucket list for the following years. Definitely the best option to live by the Adriatic sea. Make this happen and we will visit you there ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post by a favorite blogger of mine, and MSF - thanks for the intro to this blog! We are looking hard at leaving the states, and Croatia is among the top contenders for relocation, based on the COL and ease of a long term visa - so your neck of the woods!]]></description>

I was thinking the same when I got the draft of the post and started reading. Was really curious where this will lead and it was a pleasant surprise when reached the end. It put a long lasting smile on my face :)]]></description>
