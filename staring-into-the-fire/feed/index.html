Hey, Mr. G., it would be very nice. I just have to learn to sing or play the guitar (the latter is more realistic).
They are indeed. Thanks for stopping by :)]]></description>

Thank you! I hope one day it will become more than just daydreaming. Also, this is just the top of the iceberg. It seems I am very productive in thinking about options, especially when getting tired of spinning the mouse wheel every now and then. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, you have certainly thought about it! I think it is good to have some ideas of what you would like to do when FIRE. Having several options as to what you could is great! You never know how your mind starts to wonder when you don&#039;t have a job anymore ;-)

Best of luck getting yourself on FIRE.]]></description>

Great idea but these days money is not the greatest barrier but finding the time. While I would really like to follow these passions currently my daughters are my highest priority. I think that later when they will become more self-reliant and have their own interests I will have some free time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the idea of going back to your childhood roots with your music. 

Steve mentioned the barrier to entry being low for creating games. You could also check out fiverr and see if there are &quot;gigs&quot; you can set up where you create for others. Get paid while increasing your skills. Just a thought.]]></description>

Wow, that sounds amazing. If you have anything public don&#039;t hesitate to share with us :) As you pointed out, my biggest problem is free time these days. I expect to have a little bit more once both of my daughters will start school/kindergarten. Until then moonlighting is the only thing left to me :)]]></description>
