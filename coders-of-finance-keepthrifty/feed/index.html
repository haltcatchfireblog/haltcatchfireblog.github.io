					<description><![CDATA[We definitely need one :) I hear you on this last sentence, same for me, there are so many interesting technologies and passion projects we could follow, but there should be some food on the table first :)
Chris is a talented guy indeed, I keep an eye on his transition also from a full-time employee through mini-retirement into an entrepreneur. I know he makes it... fingers crossed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haltcatchfire.com/coders-of-finance-keepthrifty/#comment-171&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks, Matt. Mud, rocks, and sticks are the best toys and are ageless, we had our shares of fighting with them too (yes, even coders did that :) ). Ataris were great for gaming. My mother had a typewriter at home so later when I learned to write used it a lot just for fun. There is never too late to get into coding and it will be more and more in demand if you ever consider a career change. They say that the most effective way if you enroll into a bootcamp, where you are participating in a team and you are working on real-life projects. I regret that we did not have this option back then when I finished high school, I could be muc further both professionally and financially :) Thanks for reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post!  I&#039;m looking forward to future interviews.  I feel like I lived my childhood as luddite.  For fun e played soccer and hit each other with sticks.  We had an Atari but you couldn&#039;t program it.  I&#039;m slightly older and computers weren&#039;t really commonplace until I was almost done with high school ( I took a typing class in high school and we used typewriters!)  I&#039;m teaching myself coding now. I wish I had an introduction to programming earlier in my life, maybe the learning curve wouldn&#039;t be so steep.  Keep up the good work!]]></description>

Maybe you do not end up as a professional programmer but for me anyone who ever wrote a program in BASIC on a c64 counts as a coder in soul. Especially a â€˜choose your own adventureâ€™ type of game, I loved them and think of it as one of the nerdiest things. Also, it seems you have the foundations so the choice is yours. ;) Thanks for reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post really takes me back. I know that what I am about to spout does not really amount to much in the larger scheme of coding, but this post took me back. I got a commodore 64 at age 12 and programmed vast &#039;choose your own adventure&#039; programs in BASIC. It would take 20 minutes to load up from the tape cassette player. I played Ultima IV way too much(no online yet). In college I used the &#039;view source&#039; buttons to teach myself HTML. I made websites back when that was the wild west, 1994 or so. It looks like I could have made it in IT if I had made a serious pivot towards computers and away from Philosophy. But here I am, another useless lawyer. Thanks for letting me throw my 2 cents in.]]></description>
