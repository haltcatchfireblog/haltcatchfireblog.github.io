					<description><![CDATA[I hope you don&#039;t tell me to walk the plank, but I couldn&#039;t get beyond reading the first paragraph before I felt that I had to mention that to &quot;strike&quot; a flag means to take it down if you mean to refer to a sailing idiom. Perhaps you mean &quot;hoist&quot; the Jolly Rodger?

Thank ya, my friend! I tried my best in distilling the info I devoured in the last couple of months.
I bet that the presence of wenches was a serious factor which made piracy so cool back then :)
Thanks for reading ;)]]></description>

Thank ya matey! Somehow I just like analogies, it is such a great tool to explain something. Well, in terms of crypto I don&#039;t talk from position as I have zero money in it, but I am really excited about the technical background, the whole infrastructure, economy and the ideology behind it. I think it is a shame that this volatile speculatory hype brought the popularity to the scene. I am really curious about the endgame too, but I have  a guess that by then you won&#039;t have to &quot;bet&quot; on it because you will be obliged to use that :D Thanks for reading ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Holy smokes! (from the cannon fire) I love this post! Fantastic analogy, my Hungarian Pirate matey! 
My much less informed theory is this: Wait it out, and after the crypto bubble bursts, see who&#039;s left standing and maybe place a small bet on that vessel. I might be missing out, but I&#039;m kinda okay with that.]]></description>

That will be an interesting question. Sometimes I think that even the good ol&#039; Bitcoin can turn into her, but what is more probable that she did not reborn yet. Thank you Mattey :)]]></description>
